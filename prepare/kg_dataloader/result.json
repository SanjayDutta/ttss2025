    "author": "Jeff Poor",
    "content": "Monday, during an appearance on MSNBC’s “Deadline: White House,” former Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO), now an MSNBC contributor, urged viewers to lower their expectations for Gov. Tim Walz’s (D-MN) performance for Tuesday’s vice-presidential debate. McCaskill said she anticipated Sen. JD Vance (R-OH) would be prepared for the debate. “Yeah, I’m just a little worried about the expectations game at this point,” she said. “I think people — yes, J.D. Vance has said some really, I think, disqualifying things about women and how he views people and their role in life. But he will be articulate and he will be prepared and he will be better than Trump was. And I think it’s really going to be a challenge for Tim Walz to be able to counter what he is going to bring, and at the same time stay really likable and relatable, and then also instill confidence in the American people that he’s the better one to be in the wings in case something were to happen to the president.” “So, I just think we need to lower expectations a little bit, because then we can all be pleasantly surprised if I’m wrong and that Tim Walz just mops the floor with him the same way Kamala Harris mopped the floor with Donald Trump,” McCaskill added.

    "title": "Jimmy Carter Turns 100; First President to Live to a Century",
    "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
    "content": "Former President Jimmy Carter turns 100 years old on Tuesday, October 1, making him the first U.S. president to reach the century mark. The Hill noted: When James Earl Carter Jr. was born in 1924 in the small farming town of Plains, Ga., the U.S. still had 48 states. Wheaties cereal was just making its debut on grocery store shelves, President Calvin Coolidge was in office and Babe Ruth slugged his way to becoming the MLB’s American League batting champion.\n… The naval engineer-turned-peanut farmer won election to the Georgia state Senate in 1962, before triumphing in the Peach State’s gubernatorial race in 1971.\n… Carter won his Democratic presidential bid against incumbent President Gerald Ford in 1976 and entered the White House. Carter lost to Ronald Reagan in 1980 and is widely regarded as a failed president, due to economic stagnation and chaos in foreign policy, including the Iran hostage crisis that haunted his last year in office. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his work on the Camp David Accords of 1978, which brought peace between Israel and Egypt. He is also regarded as a disruptive former president, infamously bungling an effort to isolate North Korea during the Clinton administration, and leading efforts to demonize Israel by calling it an “apartheid” state. Carter’s wife, former First Lady Rosalynn Carter, died less than a year ago at the age of 96. Joel B.

    "title": "‘Third Lebanon War’ Begins: Israel Launches Ground Offensive",
    "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
    "content": "The Third Lebanon War has officially begun, according to Israel’s Army Radio, as Israel Defense Forces (IDF) ground forces crossed into Lebanon early Tuesday morning to remove Hezbollah outposts that threaten Israeli communities. The IDF apparently crossed into Lebanon at the “finger” or “panhandle” of Israel’s Galilee region, near the town of Metula, which was Israel’s northernmost town until the capture and annexation of the Golan Heights. In a statement, the IDF said: In accordance with the decision of the political echelon, a few hours ago, the IDF began limited, localized, and targeted ground raids based on precise intelligence against Hezbollah terrorist targets and infrastructure in southern Lebanon. These targets are located in villages close to the border and pose an immediate threat to Israeli communities in northern Israel. The IDF is operating according to a methodical plan set out by the General Staff and the Northern Command which IDF soldiers have trained and prepared for in recent months. The Israeli Air Force and IDF Artillery are supporting the ground forces with precise strikes on military targets in the area. These operations were approved and carried out in accordance with the decision of the political echelon. Operation “Northern Arrows” will continue according to the situational assessment and in parallel to combat in Gaza and in other arenas. The IDF is continuing to operate to achieve the goals of the war and is doing everything necessary to defend the citizens of Israel and return the citizens of northern Israel to their homes. The ground invasion began exactly two weeks after Israel’s security cabinet decided to adopt a new war goal, namely the safe return of Israel’s northern residents to the homes from which they were evacuated when Hezbollah opened fire in October. According to Army Radio, the goal of the war is not to occupy southern Lebanon, or to establish a “security zone” (see below), but simply to remove Hezbollah bases and positions from which terrorists have been firing on Israeli citizens. The First Lebanon War took place in 1982, when Israel invaded southern Lebanon to remove Palestinian guerillas who had shelled Israeli communities. Israel won the war but went astray when it continued on to Beirut and tried to install a friendly government in Lebanon, amid civilian casualties and atrocities by local militias. While the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) was forced to leave Lebanon, Israelis came to regard the war as their own Vietnam. For 18 years, Israel occupied a “security zone” north of the border, until repeated attacks by Hezbollah insurgents led the Israeli government to seek a negotiated withdrawal. When talks failed, Israel simply left unilaterally in 2000 — under fire from Hezbollah, which claimed victory. The Second Lebanon War began in 2006, when Hezbollah kidnapped and killed several Israeli soldiers. Israel hit Hezbollah hard, but its ground forces, which had been focused on responding to the threat of the second Palestinian intifada, were ill-prepared and underequipped. While the Israeli Air Force (IAF) successfully pounded Hezbollah positions, civilian casualties prompted global protest, and the George W. Bush administration pushed Israel to accept a stalemate and a compromise — namely, United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which said Hezbollah had to withdraw north of the Litani River. Hezbollah ignored the resolution, and neither the United Nations nor Lebanon enforced it. That allowed Hezbollah to build a massive arsenal, and underground tunnels, which posed a threat to Israeli communities. Iran, which arms and funds Hezbollah, also used the terror organization as a deterrent against an Israeli attack on Iran’s nuclear program. Last October, Hezbollah began firing at Israel after Hamas launched its brutal terror attack in the southern part of the country. The Biden administration sought a diplomatic resolution, on the heels of his push in 2022 for a deal in which Israel gave up some of its offshore gas fields in exchange for vague guarantees Hezbollah would not start another war. But rather than a deal, Hezbollah preferred to continue firing at northern Israel, or at least to emerge with an agreement that would allow it to claim its intervention had forced Israel to accept an unfavorable ceasefire in Gaza. That appears to have been a major strategic blunder. In the space of two weeks, Israel has destroyed Hezbollah’s leadership and communications infrastructure, as well as much of its arsenal, and is now pressing its advantage. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears determined to ensure that the Third Lebanon War does not end with the indeterminate result of the first two, but rather with Israeli victory, and a Lebanon free from enemy interventions.

    "title": "Watch: Tim Sheehy Rips Jon Tester in Montana Senate Debate",
    "author": "Paul Bois",
    "content": "Republican challenger Tim Sheehy had a strong performance against Sen. Jon Tester (D) in the debate for Montana’s U.S. Senate race on Monday. Tester, who faces an uphill battle for reelection against the former U.S. Navy Seal, had a tough showing on Monday night as he and Sheehy discussed a variety of topics, from abortion to border security to housing prices. In one particularly strong moment from the debate, Sheehy contrasted his service in Afghanistan to Tester cozying up with lobbyists in D.C. “Sen. Tester knows all about backroom meetings; he’s been taking them for 20 years as the number-one recipient of lobbyist cash,” said Sheehy. “So if you want to talk about backroom meetings: while I was fighting in Afghanistan, he was eating lobbyist steak in D.C.” In another moment during the debate, the two discussed housing prices and the government’s role in fixing them. “I think the federal government getting involved more in housing projects, as we see, if you want the problem to get worse, then hand more of it to the federal government,” he said. “I think having Congress come in and having the federal government try to take over housing or price-fix housing, or start turning the knobs on a market, usually that ends up making things worse.” “We’ve seen that in education where we started federally backing student loans that have driven the cost of education through the roof. Folks are now realizing that taking on that amount of debt to get a degree may not be their best path after all. So building regulation has slowed a lot of building around the country,” he added. “Here in Montana, we’ve seen massive growth in only a handful of our communities across the state while other communities are suffering, and they like to have economic growth.” SBA Pro-Life America also fact-checked Jon Tester on whether or not he believed there should be a single national law on abortion in the United States. Because Tester did not answer, the group said on X, “Tester voted for a national all-trimester abortion mandate that would wipe out pro-life protections in every state.” On the issue of border security, Sheehy attacked the Biden-Harris administration for not sealing the U.S. Southern Border. Senate Democrats and White House Democrats created this border crisis,” Sheehy said. “We had a secure border four years ago. Donald Trump handed a sealed border to the Biden-Harris administration” “Kamala Harris, the border czar, with the help of her friends on the hill, like Sen. Tester and Chuck Schumer, opened the border wide open for three years, left it open. She refused to even go there. Democrats on the hill, refused to hold the administration accountable for the largest mass migration in the history of this country. We’ve never seen that many people come in in such a short period of time,” he added. While Sheehy thanked Tester for his service in the U.S. Senate, he reminded voters how he voted to impeach former President Donald Trump twice and said on CNN that Americans should punch Trump in the face. As Newsweek recently reported, Sheehy’s odds of beating Tester have steadily increased since entering the race. “A Napolitan News survey, conducted by RMG Research, of 491 likely voters found that 50 percent would back Sheehy, compared to 43 percent who would support Tester in November. In a previous Napolitan survey conducted in August, Tester was ahead in the Montana Senate race by 5 points (49 percent to 44),” it reported last week.",

    "author": "Elizabeth Weibel",
    "content": "Among the communities affected by Hurricane Helene is the village of Chimney Rock, North Carolina, which has been described as being “washed away.” In a thread on X, Evan Donovan, a news anchor with WSOC-TV in Charlotte posted photos and videos showcasing the damage to the “tourist town.” “The homes on the other side of the water from Chimney Rock Village have walls completely sheared off,” Donovan wrote in another post. “Some look like they’re about to fall in the water.” Chimney Rock Village, which is located near Lake Lure, is where movies such as Dirty Dancing were filmed. As of 2022, the town had a population of over 200 people, according to census data. As of 2022, Lake Lure had a population of more than 1,570, according to census data. Ed Broyhill, who has a home located on the lake explained to Fox News that everything in the town had been “washed into the lake.” “The saddest thing in the world is that a lot of the folks have etched out a living catering to tourism,” Broyhill told the outlet. “They have everything from hotels and motels and restaurants and nice stores and souvenir stores and clothing stores, and all of that was washed away. Every bit of it, all of it, was washed into the lake.” Broyhill speculated that it could take “at least a year” to rebuild the tourist town, according to the outlet. As of Monday evening, there were roughly 376,577 customers in western North Carolina still without power, according to poweroutage.us.",

Trump has launched this GoFundMe campaign as an official response for MAGA supporters to offer their financial assistance to their fellow Americans impacted by Hurricane Helene,” the description on the GoFundMe page says. “With so many across the Southeastern U.S. facing challenges after the storm, President Trump is on the ground in communities to see the aftermath firsthand. All donations will be directed to help those most affected by Hurricane Helene.” As of Monday evening, the GoFundMe page had raised over $1,340,000 of its $1,000,000 goal. Among the names of people who had donated were former Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA), rockstar Kid Rock, and UFC chief Dana White. On Monday, Trump visited Valdosta, Georgia, one of the communities that have been affected by Hurricane Helene. “Valdosta has been ravaged,” Trump said during a speech on Monday. “The town is very, very badly hurting, and many thousands are without power. They’re running low on food and fuel. We brought a lot of it down with us. It’s going to be distributed now or soon, throughout Georgia as well as North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Virginia, Alabama and Tennessee.” Other communities such as Asheville, North Carolina; Narrows, Virginia; and Chimney Rock, North Carolina were affected by Hurricane Helene. As of Monday, there were roughly 301,416 customers in North Carolina still without power, according to poweroutage.us. And in southwestern Virginia, there were roughly 77,607 customers still without power, according to poweroutage.us.",

    "author": "Ian Hanchett",
    "content": "On Monday’s broadcast of CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo — who was appearing in her personal capacity as a surrogate for the Harris campaign — stated that “we have had a soft landing,” and “we need stability, predictability,” which you won’t get from 2024 Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump. Raimondo stated that Trump would cause a recession based on his tariff policies alone, and added, “he’s talking about — depending on the day, of course — but he has talked about a 60% or 100% tariff on goods coming in from China. That alone, I don’t think we realize the disruption that that will cause. A tariff on all imports, first of all, that’s anti-American, that would disrupt our economy, the global economy. So, I think that alone could kick us into a recession for sure. But, also, I just think, look, we have had a soft landing, okay? Inflation, we haven’t slayed it totally. It is on the way down. We just need — we need stability, predictability, and what you’ll have in him is unpredictable, chaotic, based upon how he feels on a particular day, and I do worry that the tariffs — but, last week he said 200% tariff on John Deere. Where does that come from? That will only raise prices and put people out of work at John Deere.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",

Reid said, “I think I will echo George Conway, in saying that Donald Trump, he called him a lunatic, I will not use that term but he is clearly in decline. Everything about Donald Trump, yes, it is worse than 2016 or 2020 because he is clearly in decline. He cannot start a story without veering off into a fictional award that he supposedly won. He cannot answer a question with any lucidity. Donald Trump is less-lucid. He is also less inhibited. That means that his inmate racism pours out in greater measure now than it did before. He cannot control himself.” She added, “What he is telling his voters, his small, his share of extreme MAGA voters is these blacks are stealing the election. Black Haitians are violent cannibals, black people are the enemy, black people will be responsible if/when I use lose. You are permitted, through my language, to do violence if necessary to stop another peaceful transfer of power. He understands that he is not winning the election. You and I both are campaign people and he is not winning the election. What he is doing is he doing what he did in the summer 2016. He is setting up to say if I lose, they stole it. He did in 2016, he just happen to win those states. He did in 2020 and he is doing it again.” Follow Pam Key on X @pamkeyNEN",

Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) stated that the Biden-Harris administration has “been very strong on” Chinese steel dumping “and keeping those tariffs in place.” But 2024 Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump’s tariff proposal “would amount to this tax, as opposed to using it, when necessary, with specific industries and specific countries.” Klobuchar began by saying, “Donald Trump’s proposal would [amount] to a $4,000 national sales tax on every American family.” Host Joy Reid then said, “People are literally calling what Trump is trying to initiate a tequila tax. Because I don’t think people fully understand, a massive tariff like what McKinley had…what you’re talking about is, your imported tequila, your imported beer that comes from Mexico, your imported beer from Germany, and your TVs, your video game systems, all of it goes up by the percentage of that tax — of that tariff.” After agreeing with Reid’s point, Klobuchar added, “And to be clear, there’s a place for tariffs, right? When you see, like, steel dumping from China and the Biden-Harris administration have been very strong on that and keeping those tariffs in place. There is a place for it.

    "title": "Port Workers Prepare to Strike as Deadline Looms Closer",
    "author": "Elizabeth Weibel",
    "content": "Thousands of workers at more than a dozen ports throughout the United States are preparing to go on strike as the deadline for their union and the United States Maritime Alliance (USMX) to reach an agreement looms closer. Dockworkers with the International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA), who work at roughy 14 ports along the East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico are set to go on strike as of October 1 if their union and the USMX do not reach an agreement regarding their labor contract, according to the Hill. Roughly “25,000 port workers employed in contain and roll-on/roll-off operations at ports on the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts” are currently covered under the current agreement, according to the USMX. The ILA is described as being the “largest union of maritime workers in North America,” and represents roughly 85,000 longshoremen located along “the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, Great Lakes, major U.S. rivers, Puerto Rico and Eastern Canada,” according to the union’s website. A report from the Conference Board found that if the workers do go on strike, it could “cause serious economic fallout.” “Just a one-week strike could cost the US economy $3.78 billion (i.e., $540 million per day),” the Conference Board wrote in the report. The report also noted that if the port workers go on strike, it would “come at a critical time” ahead of the November presidential election and “as retailers scramble to finish importing inventory to ensure customers are well supplied ahead of the busy holiday shopping season.” While President Joe Biden indicated that he would not intervene in the strike, under the Taft-Hartley Act, Biden would be allowed to get involved and “request an 80-day court-ordered cooling-off period,” according to the Hill. Ahead of the potential strike, Americans were reported to be stocking up on “essential supplies,” Fox Business reported. One person told the outlet that the possible strike had them “worried,” adding that it was “hard to be able to make ends meet as it is.” Update 12:13 am ET: The NY Times reports, “Both sides have moved off their previous positions,” the Maritime Alliance said in a news release. “We are hopeful that this could allow us to fully resume collective bargaining.”",

    "author": "Dylan Gwinn",
    "content": "Major League Baseball’s all-time hit leader, Pete Rose, died Monday at his home in Las Vegas, according to TMZ Sports. He was 83 years old. “Pete’s agent, Ryan Fiterman of Fiterman Sports, confirmed the news, saying, ‘the family is asking for privacy at this time,'” TMZ Sports reports. Rose’s accomplishments as a player are the stuff of legend. During his 24-year career, which was almost entirely spent with the Reds and Phillies, the player known as “Charlie Hustle” amassed 4,256 hits (an MLB record), 160 home runs, 1,314 RBIs, and a lifetime batting average of .303. In addition, he was named to the MLB All-Star Game 17 times and became the 1973 NL MVP. Rose also won three World Series titles with the Reds and Phillies. Rose returned to the Reds as a player-manager in 1986. Three years later, in 1989, then-MLB Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti signed an agreement in which Rose agreed to a lifetime ban in return for the league not making a formal determination about whether or not he had bet on baseball. The agreement gave Rose some leeway to say he never wagered on baseball. However, in the mid-2000s, he eventually admitted that he had.

    "title": "Memphis Sisters Fatally Overdose on Fentanyl 3 Months Apart",
    "author": "Olivia Rondeau",
    "content": "A Memphis, Tennessee, woman is now raising five of her grandchildren after losing her two daughters to fentanyl just months apart. “I’m about all they’ve got, except for their uncles,” the grieving mother, Brenda Diggs, told WREG of her grandkids. “I just don’t know. It’s mind-boggling.” Her eldest daughter, 42-year-old Kenia Everette Wooten, was trying to turn her life around when she became addicted to drugs. According to Diggs, Kenia “lost her self-esteem” after becoming a mom at just 15. “And I guess she thought building her self-esteem and having sex with guys would make her feel better about herself. She just spiraled and it just was bad,” the mom recounted. Even with the hardships of becoming a teen mother, Diggs said Kenia had begun to get her life together when she was injured at work. “She hurt her ankle, real bad. In fact, I think she broke it, and then they put her on some kind of medicine,” the mom told the outlet. By the time her prescription was up, Kenia was addicted to pills. “That’s when she decided she could buy other people’s prescriptions,” said Diggs. It was January 22, 2022, when she got the call that her daughter was dead. “[Kenia’s boyfriend] called me, ‘Ms. Brenda, Kenia’s dead.’ I’m like, ‘What? What are you talking about?’ I’m asleep, and he’s like ‘she died. She took something and she died,'” she recalled. Diggs got up and rushed to the hotel where Kenia was staying, but it was too late. “I went in, and lo and behold, Kenia was on the floor. The paramedics were there, but she was dead on the floor.” The cause of death was ruled as an accidental overdose of fentanyl. Kenia’s younger sister, 34-year-old Keshia Diggs, had also just been released from a prison stint stemming from prostitution charges. In just three months, she would die from a fentanyl overdose as well. Diggs became worried on March 25, 2022, when Keshia did not come home after having been out for a number of days. The mom discovered that her daughter had never actually left when she checked her bedroom. “Went in there, and the smell just almost knocked me out. Like, what is that smell,” Diggs said. “I lost it. I ran out screaming, you know and ran down the stairs and outside with my phone. I called 911, and, you know, I told them, I said, my daughter’s not right. Can you please send somebody I think she’s sick or something?” “Lo and behold, they said it was fentanyl. She died of an accidental overdose of fentanyl.” Diggs said she noticed that her younger daughter was using some type of drug when she saw her “nodding” out while doing her hair. “She was just out of it, like, ‘What is wrong with you?’ I’m thinking to myself, she’s doing something.” Diggs has been left to put together the broken pieces of her family after the deadly opioid took both daughters from her. David Fuller, an overdose prevention specialist with the Memphis Area Prevention Coalition, said the stories of families experiencing losses like this are far too common. “I wish I could say that that was the first one of those stories that I’ve heard. But it’s absolutely not,” he told WREG. Many people do not even realize they are consuming fentanyl, he explained. “They thought they were doing heroin or something else,” Fuller said. “Then what we saw is fentanyl began to infiltrate the rest of the drug supply. Counterfeit pills. Counterfeit prescription opioids.” “It’s so powerful that once a user becomes addicted to fentanyl, other drugs are not going to cut it because they’re not strong enough,” he continued, adding that fentanyl is the “deadliest drug that we’ve seen in this country.” Provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) revealed that approximately 107,543 people fatally overdosed on drugs in the U.S. in 2023. While the CDC does not break down the categories to see the exact number of fentanyl deaths, the most recent data from 2022 shows that 74,000 drug overdose deaths involved synthetic opioids other than methadone — of which the most popular is fentanyl. As tens of thousands of Americans die each year from the drug, amounts of fentanyl that could kill millions of people are being seized all over the country. In August, the Citrus County Sheriff’s Office of Florida found over 13 pounds of fentanyl — enough to kill three million people, Breitbart News reported. In another recent Florida incident, two pounds of fentanyl was found washed up on Daytona Beach in September. Meanwhile, a traffic stop in Roswell, Georgia, yielded enough fentanyl to kill roughly 60,000 people. An April report by the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) validated a key claim in New York Times bestselling author Peter Schweizer’s latest book, Blood Money — that China has been subsidizing the production and export of fentanyl precursor chemicals and other synthetic narcotics. “Specifically, there’s a Chinese gang called UBG that’s widely credited with setting up the Sinaloa Cartel in Mexico and making them the kings of fentanyl,” Schweizer told Fox News in March. “The leader of that gang is a guy named Chang An-lo who goes by the name White Wolf. It was White Wolf’s business with [a] partner who wired a $5 million if interest-free, forgivable loan to the Biden family,” the investigative journalist said. “And it was specifically designated not just for Hunter, for the family. So does Joe Biden want to have a conversation about these tough issues? Does he want to hold China to account? Absolutely not, and I’m convinced it’s because of these financial entanglements.”",

    "title": "Moskowitz on Israel Ignoring Biden’s Hezbollah Ceasefire Calls: ‘Glad’ Israel Ditched ‘Appeasement’ that Led to 10/7",
    "author": "Ian Hanchett",
    "content": "On Monday’s broadcast of NewsNation’s “Elizabeth Vargas Reports,” Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-FL) responded to Israel launching attacks on Hezbollah despite President Joe Biden’s calls for a ceasefire by stating that he’s “glad Israel is at the point now that they’re no longer going to allow these threats to exist on their border. We saw what appeasement strategy looks like. It looks like what Hamas did on October 7. There was a ceasefire in place, and then Hamas launched war.” Host Elizabeth Vargas asked, “I want to get your thoughts on what’s happening today in the Middle East. … There are reports today that Israeli troops are amassing along the Lebanese border, special forces raids from the IDF are already rading and going into Lebanon. What is your sense? I know that President Biden has been urging calm and hoping for a ceasefire. That does not look like that’s about to happen. There were reports today from U.S. officials that they had convinced Israel not to launch a ground invasion. What do you think is going on?” Moskowitz responded, “Well, first, let me say good. I’m glad Israel is at the point now that they’re no longer going to allow these threats to exist on their border. We saw what appeasement strategy looks like. It looks like what Hamas did on October 7. There was a ceasefire in place, and then Hamas launched war. By the way, Hezbollah could have stayed out of that. But instead, Hezbollah came to the aid of Hamas and launched over 9,000 rockets into Israel, killed 16 kids on a soccer field, made 50,000 people flee their home[s] in the north of Israel. I don’t want to see a regional war and I don’t want to see a full-scale invasion of Lebanon. I do think Israel is going to do limited missions to kind of push Hezbollah terrorists and militants back further into Lebanon and continue to degrade Hezbollah’s capability to threaten Israel. Look, on October 7, Israel looked like a soft target. They looked like a soft target to Iran. The last couple of weeks, it doesn’t look so much like a soft target. It’s important that Israel re-establishes that deterrence so that Iran realizes that there’s — that they no longer want to mess with the state of Israel.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",

    "title": "Dearborn Memorial Service Mourns ‘Perfect’ Hezbollah Chief Nasrallah, Accuses U.S. of ‘Terrorism’",
    "author": "Joshua Klein",
    "content": "A memorial service for Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Michigan featured praise for prominent terror figures as well as denunciations of the United States’ “terrorism.” On Saturday, a memorial service for slain Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah took place at the Hadi Youth Community Center in Dearborn, Michigan. The event, which was live-streamed on YouTube, featured fiery speeches from local religious leaders and activists who praised Nasrallah and Iran’s leadership while condemning America. Imam Usama Abdulghani, who led the memorial, declared that Nasrallah was now “happy,” and that his martyrdom “at the hands of the wickedest and most evil of Allah’s creations” was a “reward” from Allah for all of the “jihad’ he has waged. Teacher and activist Tarek Bazzi delivered a passionate speech, celebrating not only Nasrallah but also the Iranian revolutionaries who shaped Hezbollah’s ideology. He praised Iran’s former leader Ruhollah Khomeini and current Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, calling Nasrallah “immaculate” and “perfect.” Offering condolences to “the entire Muslim nation,” Bazzi challenged attendees to identify any other religion that has produced men as “godly” as Khomeini, late Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani, slain Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, and others, naming several key figures revered in Hezbollah and Iranian circles. In a sharp denunciation of U.S. policy, Bazzi accused American institutions — specifically the White House, Congress, and the Pentagon — of projecting their own “terrorism” onto “the soldiers and saints of the Lord of the universe.” The service was also marked by local Shiite poet Hassan Salamey, who referred to Iran’s Supreme Leader Khamenei as “our greatest leader,” while warning he may possess Ali’s sword “on your throats in Tel Aviv.” Dearborn, with its large Muslim population, has long been a focal point for anti-Israel demonstrations, drawing attention to growing radicalism within the U.S. In April, a viral video showed anti-Israel protests in Dearborn, where demonstrators were captured chanting, “Death to America” and “Death to Israel,” during an International Al-Quds Day rally. The video stirred national controversy and intensified scrutiny of pro-Hezbollah activities in the U.S. The clip showed activists condemning both Israel and America in the harshest of terms, with Bazzi insisting the chants were only logical. In response, Steven Stalinsky, director of the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), told Fox News that the Dearborn rallies have been happening for over 20 years and have become a “hotbed of hate,” where rallies and sermons can be seen “in support for Hamas, Hezbollah, [and] Iran.” Nasrallah, who served as Secretary-General of Hezbollah since 1992, was a founding member of the Iran-backed Shiite terror group. Revered by Hezbollah supporters for leading the group through conflicts with Israel, Nasrallah was killed on Saturday in a precision airstrike on his Beirut bunker. Under his leadership, Hezbollah’s terrorism capabilities grew significantly. Israel has been engaged in ongoing clashes with Hezbollah after the group launched attacks following Hamas’s October 7 assault on Israeli civilians, which left nearly 1,200 dead and more than 240 hostages taken. Having actively sought to expand its influence beyond the Middle East, Hezbollah is designated a terrorist organization by more than a dozen countries and international entities, including major Western nations, members of the European Union, and most Arab League member states, due to its involvement in terrorist activities against American, French, Israeli, and other targets. Former President Donald Trump has denounced Hezbollah, stating, “No terrorist group other than al-Qaeda has more American blood on its hands.” On Sunday, Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton called for the elimination of “all of Hezbollah’s leadership” while insisting that the United States “should let Israel win” against Tehran’s key terrorist proxy in the region.

    "title": "DirecTV Buys Rival Dish as It Fights the Onslaught of Streaming Services",
    "author": "Breitbart News",
    "content": "DirecTV is buying Dish and Sling, a deal it has sought to complete for years, as the company seeks to better compete against streaming services that have become dominant. DirecTV said Monday that it will acquire Dish TV and Sling TV from its owner EchoStar in a debt exchange transaction that includes a payment of $1, plus the assumption of approximately $9.8 billion in debt. The prospect of a DirecTV-Dish combo has long been rumored, with headlines about reported talks popping up over the years. And the two almost merged more than two decades ago — but the Federal Communications Commission blocked their owners’ then-$18.5 billion deal, citing antitrust concerns. The pay-for-TV market has shifted significantly since. As more and more consumers tune into online streaming giants, demand for more traditional satellite continues to shrink. And, although high-profile acquisitions have proven to be particularly tough under the Biden-Harris administration, that may make regulators more inclined to approve DirecTV and Dish’s pairing this time around. DirecTV said Monday that the transaction will help it bring smaller content packages to consumer at lower prices and essentially provide a one-stop shopping experience for entertainment programming. It’s hoping this will appeal to those who have left satellite video services for streaming. The company said that combined, DirecTV and Dish have collectively lost 63% of their satellite customers since 2016. “DirecTV operates in a highly competitive video distribution industry,” DirecTV CEO Bill Morrow said in a statement. “With greater scale, we expect a combined DirecTV and Dish will be better able to work with programmers to realize our vision for the future of tv, which is to aggregate, curate, and distribute content tailored to customers’ interests, and to be better positioned to realize operating efficiencies while creating value for customers through additional investment.” The current deal could provide a key lifeline for EchoStar. The Colorado-based telecommunications company has reportedly faced the prospect of bankruptcy as it continues to burn through cash and see losses pile up. In a recent securities filing, EchoStar disclosed that it had just $521 million in “cash on hand.” And the company forecast negative cash flows for the remainder of the year — while also pointing to major looming debt payments, with more than $1.98 billion of debt set to mature in November. “With an improved financial profile, we will be better positioned to continue enhancing and deploying our nationwide 5G Open RAN wireless network,” EchoStar President and CEO Hamid Akhavan said. “This will provide U.S. wireless consumers with more choices and help to drive innovation at a faster pace.” By shedding Dish, EchoStar will be able to focus its efforts elsewhere, like its wireless carrier Boost Mobile. “We are playing to win in the wireless business. there’s no doubt about it,” Akhavan said during a conference call, adding that the company may need to seek additional funding and financing in the future to achieve its goals. Shares of EchoStar fell more than 14% in Monday midday trading. The DirecTV and Dish deal is targeted to close in 2025’s fourth quarter. But it is contingent on several factors, including regulatory approvals and bondholders writing off nearly $1.6 billion in debt related to Dish. The combined company will be based in El Segundo, California. “We believe regulatory approval is likely to be greater than 50% given the opportunity for the combined company to improve its competitiveness to offer a range of linear video packages as well as to take a more aggressive stance on offering a live streaming video product,” Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research wrote in a note to clients. But the analyst added that there’s still significant uncertainty related to whether or not the Federal Communications Commission, Department of Justice and other possible regulators give the necessary approvals, based on previous talks with company management and industry experts over the last few years. Shortly before DirecTV made its announcement, AT&T said it was selling its remaining stake in DirecTV to private equity firm TPG in a deal valued at about $7.6 billion. The move ends the communication giant’s remaining ties to the entertainment industry. AT&T said Monday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it will receive payments from TPG and DirecTV for its remaining 70% stake in the satellite TV company. This includes $1.7 billion in the second half of the year and $5.4 billion next year. The remaining amount will be paid in 2029. AT&T purchased DirectTV for $48.5 billion back in 2015. But in 2021, following the loss of millions of customers, AT&T sold a 30% stake of the business to TPG for $16.25 billion. AT&T’s deal is expected to close in the second half of 2025.",

    "title": "FBI Agrees to Pay Dozens of Female Recruits over $22 Million in Discrimination, Harassment Lawsuit",
    "author": "Olivia Rondeau",
    "content": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has agreed to pay out more than $22 million to female recruits who sued the bureau over alleged sexual discrimination and harassment at its training academy in Virginia. The class-action lawsuit, filed in 2019, claims that dozens of women were dismissed from the Quantico law enforcement academy due to their sex and “routinely” faced harassment from instructors, the Associated Press (AP) reported. The alleged harassment included inappropriate sexual advances, remarks on recruits’ breast sizes, false allegations of infidelity, and telling recruits to take contraceptives to “control their moods,” the lawsuit states. In one of its largest ever settlement agreements, the FBI said Monday that they will pay the 34 complainants — a move that still needs to be approved by a federal judge, according to the AP. “These problems are pervasive within the FBI and the attitudes that created them were learned at the academy,” said the plaintiffs’ attorney, David J. Shaffer. “This case will make important major changes in these attitudes.” According to the female recruits, they suffered in a hostile working environment where they were “excessively targeted for correction and dismissal in tactical situations for perceived lack of judgment” and subjective “suitability” criteria. “Through passive tolerance, the FBI has intentionally allowed the Good Old Boy Network to flourish unrestrained at the FBI Academy,” the suit argues. While agreeing to the multi-million-dollar payout, the FBI said in a Monday statement obtained by the AP that it has “taken significant steps over the past five years to further ensure gender equity in the training and development of all our trainees.” The settlement also includes a chance for the dismissed recruits to re-enter FBI training with “guaranteed placement” in one of their preferred field offices for those who meet the requirements The FBI has also “agreed to a review by outside experts who will work to ensure that female recruits face a fair evaluation process,” the outlet reported. According to Shaffer, it is too late for some women to come back, as they have already moved on to other fields. “The FBI has deprived itself of some genuinely exceptional talent,” the attorney said. A 2020 investigation conducted by the AP identified “several” senior FBI officials who “quietly” resigned from their positions with full benefits after allegations of sexual misconduct. The accused officials even maintained anonymity, reportedly “allowing them to land on their feet in the private sector or even remain in law enforcement.” The allegations against them included unwanted touching, sexual advances, and coercion against women within the bureau. “In one case, an FBI assistant director retired after the inspector general’s office concluded he harassed a female subordinate and sought an improper relationship with her,” the outlet noted as an example. The payout agreement comes just months after a $138.7 million settlement with the victims of disgraced former Team USA Dr. Larry Nassar was reached due to the FBI’s failure to intervene and stop the sexual abuse.",

    "title": "Walz’s Alleged Ties to Chinese Communist Party Deepen on Eve of VP Debate with Vance",
    "author": "Paul Bois",
    "content": "Rep. James Comer (R-KY) has subpoenaed Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas about unspecified allegations of Chinese Communist Party (CCP) connections against Democrat Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. In a letter accompanying the subpoena released on Thursday, Comer said the House Oversight and Accountability Committee received information from a whistleblower about “serious concern among Department of Homeland Security (DHS) personnel regarding a longstanding connection between” Tim Walz and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The letter was issued just one day before Walz is set to debate Trump vice-presidential pick JD Vance in the televised debate on Tuesday. Per the Hill: Specifically, Comer pointed to a nonclassified chat that DHS employees used on Microsoft Teams titled “NST NFT Bi-Weekly Sync” that he said contains relevant information, in addition to further classified and unclassified documents in the control of DHS. The acronym stands for “Nation State Threat — National Functional Team,” according to the committee. Comer did not go into detail about what kind of concerns were raised about Walz’s alleged connection to China but said the information came through a whistleblower. The subpoena gave a deadline of Oct. 7 to produce the communication in the Microsoft Teams group chat relating to Walz from July 1, 2024, to present, as well as any intelligence information reports or regional intelligence notes since Nov. 2023 to present relating to Walz, his staff, or his gubernatorial office. The letter specified that the committee began investigating CCP influence in the United States government “long before Governor Walz was elevated to be the vice-presidential candidate” for Kamala Harris. “In particular, if a state governor and major political party’s nominee for Vice President of the United States has been a witting or unwitting participant in the CCP’s efforts to weaken our nation, this would strongly suggest that there are alarming weaknesses in the federal government’s effort to defend the United States from the CCP’s political warfare that must be urgently addressed,” Comer wrote. A former educator, Walz spent a year teaching in China in 1989 and visited the country many times afterwards while leading field trips to the country. House Republicans have been questioning his ties to the CCP since Kamala Harris tapped him as her VP pick. The letter from Comer dropped on the same day that the Washington Free Beacon released a report debunking a claim Walz made during a 2014 congressional hearing wherein he said that he had been in Hong Kong during China’s Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. Walz was, in fact, at home in Nebraska at the time. “I was just going to teach high school in Foshan in Guangdong, and was in Hong Kong in May of ‘89,” he said at the time. “And as the events were unfolding, several of us went in. And I still remember the train station in Hong Kong.” “There was a large number of, especially European, I think, very angry that we would still go after what had happened, but it was my belief at that time that the diplomacy was going to happen on many levels,” he added. Media outlets from New York Times, CBS News, and National Public Radio have repeated Walz’s story when “in reality, local news reports show that Walz was at home in Nebraska in May and June of 1989, as protests convulsed China and the government’s response turned the world’s attention to its gross human rights violations,” according to the Beacon. Walz did not depart for China until August that year. “Contemporaneous news reports show Walz touring a National Guard storeroom in Alliance, Nebraska, in May 1989. They indicate that Walz did not leave the United States until August of that year, at least two months after the student protests ended with the Tiananmen Square massacre,” the report added.",

    "title": "Trump Assassination Suspect Ryan Wesley Routh Pleads Not Guilty",
    "author": "Elizabeth Weibel",
    "content": "The suspect who allegedly attempted to assassinate former President Donald Trump pleaded not guilty to the charges brought against him. Ryan Wesley Routh was previously charged with the “attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate, possessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, assaulting a federal officer,” possessing a firearm and ammunition as a convicted felon, and possessing a firearm that had an obliterated serial number, according to a press release from the Department of Justice (DOJ). On Monday, Routh appeared before United States Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart, and defense attorneys for Routh reportedly “entered a not guilty plea” and asked for “a jury trial,” according to NBC News. The not-guilty plea from Routh comes after a federal grand jury charged Routh with the attempted assassination of Trump after prosecutors had indicated that they intended to seek an assassination charge against the suspect. Routh had initially been charged with possessing a firearm as a convicted felon and with possessing a firearm with a destroyed serial number. The charges against Routh came the day after the U.S. Secret Service allegedly saw the barrel of his AK-style rifle through the fence where he had been hiding in the bushes near Trump International Golf Course West Palm Beach where Trump was playing golf. After being spotted, Routh reportedly fled the scene before being apprehended. As Breitbart News previously reported, agents discovered a GoPro camera, two backpacks, and an AK-47-style rifle where Routh had been hiding. The second assassination attempt comes after gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire at Trump’s July 13, 2024, rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Trump was shot by a “bullet that pierced the upper part” of his right ear.",

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) data, divulged to Congress last week, reveals that the agency’s non-detained docket includes over 425,000 convicted criminal migrants and more than 222,000 migrants with pending criminal charges. By the end of the year, more than eight million migrants will be on ICE’s non-detained docket. Those on the non-detained docket are known to ICE but live in American towns and cities while awaiting their deportation hearings. For perspective, when former President Donald Trump left office in early 2021, only about 3.2 million migrants were on ICE’s non-detained docket, indicating that Biden and Harris have almost tripled the docket’s population. Meanwhile, Biden and Harris’s DHS has kept ICE detention beds unfilled. Congress currently funds 41,500 detention beds, but the latest federal data shows DHS is only utilizing 37,395 detention beds, leaving more than 4,100 beds open and available but unused. A recent report from the House Homeland Security Committee detailed that while Biden and Harris have sought to cut detention bed space, more than 85 percent of migrants arriving at the southern border are ultimately being released into the U.S. interior. Only a fraction are monitored by DHS through the Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program. In April, Acting ICE Director Patrick Lechleitner urged Congress to fund at least 50,000 detention beds. Other experts have suggested that the federal government needs hundreds of thousands of detention beds to keep up with record illegal immigration and ensure that migrants are not released into the U.S. interior.

    "title": "Commerce Sec’y: ‘Haven’t Been Particularly Involved’ on Port Strike that ‘Could Be Incredibly Disruptive to Commerce’",
    "author": "Ian Hanchett",
    "content": "On Monday’s broadcast of CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo — who was appearing in her personal capacity as a surrogate for the Harris campaign — stated that she has “not been very focused on” where a potential port strike could have the biggest impact and hasn’t “been particularly involved” in the strike issue that she acknowledged “could be incredibly disruptive to commerce.” Co-host Becky Quick asked, “I realize you’re here as a surrogate for the vice president’s campaign, but there’s so much news of the day that I feel we have to ask you about. I wanted to start with this potential strike at the ports that’s expected to take place tonight at midnight. Obviously, this is the first time since the 1970s that you would see strikes all up and down, not only the east coast, but the Gulf ports. What would this mean for commerce in this country, what would this mean for businesses if we go into this strike, and what do you know about it?” Raimondo responded, “So, as you said, I’m here in my personal capacity. I would say, look, it’s not a secret that this would be — depending on how long it lasts — could be incredibly disruptive to commerce. As you well know, … so much commerce moves through the ports, and, if it goes a few days, I think, I’m sure, companies probably have their plans set. But especially, we’re in peak season getting ready for the Christmas season. If a strike were to drag on, I think it could be really, very, very disruptive to commerce. So, I do hope that the parties stay at the table and resolve it as quickly as possible, hopefully averting a strike, but certainly, keeping the length of the strike as short as possible. The knock-on effects through the supply chain become quite extensive.” Quick then asked, “Where are the issues most prominent, where have you been kind of focused and hearing on what would happen if the strike goes, let’s say, longer than a week?” Raimondo answered, “I have not been very focused on that. I would refer you to the White House or the transportation secretary.” Quick then asked, “I know the administration and the president himself have said that he is not going to push the two sides together, he’s urged them to talk. And I just wonder, have you heard from business leaders — you probably are the person in the administration who has business leaders’ ear more than just about anybody else — in terms of what this might mean for them?” Raimondo responded, “I want to stay in the bounds of the Hatch Act here. So, if you wanted to have me back as Commerce Secretary later in the week, maybe we could talk about that. But, as I said, I haven’t been particularly involved.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",

    "title": "Florida Poll: Support for Abortion Amendment Falls Short, but Many Voters Are Undecided",
    "author": "Katherine Hamilton",
    "content": "New polling out of Florida shows a proposed abortion amendment falling short of the support needed for passage — but many voters are still unsure how they will vote. The survey, reported on by Florida Politics and conducted by a Republican-led firm called Victory Insights, found that 49.7 percent of respondents support the abortion amendment, which falls short of the 60 percent support needed to pass. Another 29. 2 percent oppose the amendment, and 21.2 percent are undecided. “It’s important to note that more than 1 in 5 voters remain undecided, providing ample opportunity for the amendment to pick up another (about) 10 percent support in order to reach the threshold,” senior pollster Ben Galbraith said in a polling memo obtained by the outlet. Amendment 4 bars the state from restricting abortion before viability (approximately 24 weeks) or later in pregnancy “when necessary to protect the patient’s health, as determined by the patient’s healthcare provider.” It reads: No law shall prohibit, penalize, delay, or restrict abortion before viability or when necessary to protect the patient’s health, as determined by the patient’s healthcare provider. This amendment does not change the Legislature’s constitutional authority to require notification to a parent or guardian before a minor has an abortion. If Florida voters pass the measure with at least 60 percent support in November, the abortion amendment would undo the state’s six-week limit and basically create a permanent right to abortion in the state that could only be undone with another ballot measure or an uphill legal battle. RELATED: Ten States Will Have Abortion on the Ballot in November By political affiliation, 48 percent of Republicans polled say they plan to vote against the measure, while 29 percent are undecided, and 23 percent plan to vote in favor of it, the survey found. Unaffiliated voters and Democrats show far more support for the measure. Nearly 6 in 10 (57 percent) of unaffiliated voters in the Sunshine State plan to vote for the measure, while 24 percent are undecided, and 19 percent plan to vote against it. Seventy-six percent of Democrats plan to support the measure, while 12 percent are undecided, and 13 percent plan to vote against it, the survey found. By age group, adults ages 18 to 49 are more supportive (55 percent) of the amendment than 50- to 64-year-olds (49 percent), and those 65 and up (45 percent). Various polls within the past few months have shown the amendment narrowly failing or passing, often within the margin of error (see here, here, here, here, here, here, and here). The Republican Party of Florida has formally opposed the amendment, arguing that Amendment 4, along with Amendment 3 related to recreational marijuana, are too extreme for the state. Party Chairman Evan Power said: Floridians are confident that their legislature has been passing laws that reflect the priorities of our state. Amendments 3 and 4 are unnecessary attempts by an increasingly shrinking minority who know the only way to win support for their radical agenda is to confuse and mislead the electorate. In addition, the Republican Party of Florida supports the legislature’s desire to make school board races partisan, create a constitutional right to hunt and fish, and eliminate the taxpayer burden of public campaign financing. The Florida Democrats are a dead carcass on the side of the road, but outside dark money groups are looking to promote their far-left ideology by attempting to confuse Florida voters. The Florida GOP stands ready to correct the record and defeat the radical left while enshrining in our Constitution more rights for our citizens. The Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) has also come out against the amendment, saying it “threatens women’s safety.” The AHCA warned that the measure’s vague language could lead to the overturning of at least 20 abortion-related laws, including parental consent, if it is passed. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) has also spoken out against the abortion amendment and said it was “written in a way that’s intentionally designed to deceive voters.” The poll was conducted Sept. 22-25, 2024, among 600 likely general election voters throughout Florida. The margin of error is ±4.4 percentage points. Katherine Hamilton is a political reporter for Breitbart News. You can follow her on X @thekat_hamilton.",

    "title": "Maritime Historians Find ‘Elusive’ Lake Michigan Shipwreck After Nearly 130 Years",
    "author": "Olivia Rondeau",
    "content": "An “elusive” tugboat that sank in Lake Michigan nearly 130 years ago has finally been found by maritime historians who set out on a three-day-mission to solve the mystery of where it went. The John Evenson, a 54-foot, ten-year-old wood steam tugboat went unseen from its demise on June 5, 1895, until September 13, USA Today reported. Named after the captain of Milwaukee, Illinois’, U.S. Life-Saving Service Station in the 1870s and ’80s who died at a young age, the John Evenson was assisting another vessel, the I. Watson Stephenson, when it went under. “The Evenson’s captain ran across the bow of the much larger Stephenson, which struck the tug, capsizing her and sending her immediately to the bottom,” wrote historian Brendon Baillod in a recent report on his findings. “The tug’s five crew were cast into the water and rescued except for the tug’s fireman, Martin Boswell, who was working below deck and was carried down with the vessel and lost.” Several attempts to find the lost boat over the years proved unsuccessful, with a local dive club even offering a $500 reward for it at one point, according to USA Today. What was meant to be a multi-day affair was cut short after a “deliberate search using historical records and remote sensing technology” led Baillod and fellow Wisconsin Underwater Archeology Association historian Bob Jaeck to finally locate the boat. The pair found the Evenson while tuning their sonar equipment when a “huge boiler crawled across the screen” after just five minutes, Baillod wrote. The historians then deployed a remote operated vehicle (ROV) to observe the sunken ship’s “giant propeller, steam engine and boiler.” “The tug’s hull-bed is present along with all of her machinery, giving a fascinating look at the steam technology of the late 1800s,” Baillod said of the wreckage, which was found off the Wisconsin coast near Algoma. Another maritime historian, Tamara Thomsen, and diver Zach Whitrock arrived at the scene the next day to see the boat. “A 3D photogrammetry model was created by capturing over 2000 high resolution images, recording the site in detail. Plans for the site include nominating it to the National Register of Historic Places and making it available for sport divers to visit,” said Baillod. The Evenson’s discovery makes for the third significant shipwreck found by Baillod and Jaeck in the last two years, as they found the sunken schooners Trinidad and the Margaret A. Muir around the same area of Lake Michigan. Even with their recent successes in finding other shipwrecks, Baillod and Jaeck said they turned to each other “gobsmacked” when they found the “elusive” Evenson. “It was almost like the wreck wanted to be found,” Baillod told USA Today. “It never gets old,” he added. “It’s always exciting.”",

    "title": "Kamala Harris Supports No Jail Time ‘for Smoking Weed’ Despite Jailing Nearly 2,000 People for Marijuana Offenses",
    "author": "Elizabeth Weibel",
    "content": "Vice President Kamala Harris expressed support for marijuana legalization, noting that “people should not be” jailed “for smoking weed,” despite her record of having overseen nearly 2,000 convictions for marijuana-related offenses. During an interview with All The Smoke podcast, when asked about her views on cannabis, Harris expressed that it was time to legalize marijuana and that they needed to “stop criminalizing” smoking weed. “I just feel strongly, people should not be going to jail for smoking weed,” Harris said. “And, we know historically what that has meant and who has gone to jail.” “Second, I just think we have come to a point where we have to understand that we need to legalize it and stop criminalizing this behavior,” Harris added. “And so, I’ve actually… this is not a new position for me. I have felt for a long time we need to legalize it, so that’s where I am on that.” As Breitbart News has reported, Harris stated during a roundtable event in March that she believes “nobody should have to go to jail for smoking weed.” Harris and President Joe Biden have also made statements in posts on X that “no one should go to jail for smoking weed,” after the Department of Justice took steps to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I drug to a Schedule III drug. The support from Harris to legalize marijuana comes after she had overseen almost 2,000 convictions for marijuana-related offenses while she served as the district attorney of San Francisco, according to data obtained by the Bay Area News Group, Mercury News reported in 2019. Harris was criticized by former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (I-HI) regarding her prosecutorial record during a Democratic primary debate in 2019. During the debate, Gabbard stated that Harris “put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations,” referencing numbers from an article by the Washington Free Beacon, which used data from the time that Harris served as the attorney general of California, according to the Mercury News: During the last presidential debate in July, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard blasted Harris over marijuana convictions, saying she “put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana.” Gabbard was misleadingly citing figures for all of California while Harris was attorney general — even though the vast majority of marijuana cases in the state are prosecuted by independently elected county district attorneys. As San Francisco DA from 2004 through 2010, however, Harris had wide latitude to decide which marijuana cases to prosecute and what sentences to seek in the city. “Over Harris’ seven years as top prosecutor, her attorneys won 1,956 misdemeanor and felony convictions for marijuana possession, cultivation, or sale, according to data from the DA’s office,” the outlet reported. “That includes people who were convicted of marijuana offenses and more serious crimes at the same time.”",

    "author": "Hannah Knudsen",
    "content": "Christian Evangelist Franklin Graham, President of Samaritan’s Purse, offered encouragement for the victims devastated by the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, as well as a prayer for former President Donald Trump, as he and others gathered in Valdosta, Georgia, to deliver relief items to those affected by the massive storm. “We came down with truckloads of things, and we’re going to have that done by Franklin’s incredible organization. They’ve done such a good job,” Trump said. “We’ve done this before, but we have a lot of truckloads of different items — from oil to water to all sorts of equipment that’s going to help them,” Trump continued, delivering remarks and making it clear that they are there to “stand in complete solidarity with the people of Georgia and with all of those suffering in the terrible aftermath of Hurricane Helene.” “Hurricane Helene turned out to be a big one — like just about the biggest that anyone’s seen,” Trump said. “Valdosta has been ravaged. The town is very, very badly hurting, and many thousands are without power. They’re running low on food and fuel. We brought a lot of it down with us. It’s going to be distributed now or soon, throughout Georgia as well as North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Virginia, Alabama and Tennessee,” Trump continued. RELATED — “Completely Gone”: Flooding from Hurricane Helene Devastates North Carolina Town Trump asked Graham to speak. Graham said the wrecked building behind him “represents hundreds of thousands of people that have lost homes, businesses, friends, loved ones, and it’s going to take an army of volunteers and people to respond.” “And of course, at Samaritan’s Purse, we want to respond always in Jesus’s name, and we want people to know that God loves them, that God cares for them,” Graham emphasized. “Sometimes, when a storm like this comes, people think, ‘Well, maybe God is mad at us. Maybe this is his judgment,'” he said, making it clear that it is not the case. “No, God loves us. How do I know that? Because our Bible tells us that God loves us and cares for us,” he said. “And yes, there are storms in life, but God will take us through those storms, if we put our faith and trust in His Son, Jesus Christ.” RELATED — Donald Trump Leads Moment of Silence for Lives Lost from Hurricane Helene Graham then led everyone in a prayer, thanking the Lord for the men and women volunteering to help those in need to recover. “Thank you for the President, who has taken time to come and to see it for himself, to shake hands, to encourage and to smile on the faces of people that have been hurt and devastated by this storm,” Graham prayed. “Father, we ask for help. Father, we pray that, as we come to this election, that your will be done. And so Father, we pray for the President: Strengthen him. Protect him. Father, we thank you, and it’s in Jesus’ name we pray this prayer. Amen,” he added. WATCH: The remarks came as Trump visited Georgia in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, which resulted in hundreds of thousands losing their possessions and at least 116 losing their lives.",

    "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
    "content": "Hassan Nasrallah, the terrorist leader of Hezbollah who was killed by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in an airstrike on Friday, was a radical Islamist, antisemite, and Holocaust denier who wanted to destroy Israel and to expel the Jews. The reality of his beliefs stands in contrast to the almost laudatory way in which some media outlets presented him. His most infamous quote is: “If Jews all gather in Israel, it will save us the trouble of going after them worldwide.” That statement from 2001 was reported in the New York Times in 2004, but only from a secondary source. What is clear is that Nasrallah hated Jews and, at best, wanted to expel them from Israel to other countries. In 2000, he delivered a speech at a Shiite Muslim ceremony in which he said (via Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs): The Jews invented the legend of the Nazi atrocities. It is clear that the numbers they talk about are greatly exaggerated. They can speak of fabricated or exaggerated massacres that occurred during the Second World War, but we must forget the massacres that they committed against us and the peoples of the region which are documented and proven… The only way to achieve just and comprehensive peace is not through the implementation of [United Nations Security Council] resolutions 425, 242 and 338 but by restoring all the Arab lands to their sons and owners, without war and conflict. Let us spare bloodshed. Let the Yemenite Jews return to Yemen, the Moroccan Jews to Morocco, the Ethiopian Jews to Ethiopia, the European Jews to Europe, and the American Jews to America. The Palestinian people will get their land back and establish their state… Anyone who reads the Koran and the holy writings of the monotheistic religions sees what they did to the prophets, and what acts of madness and slaughter the Jews carried out throughout history… Anyone who reads these texts cannot think of co-existence with them, of peace with them, or about accepting their presence, not only in Palestine of 1948 but even in a small village in Palestine, because they are a cancer which is liable to spread again at any moment… Hezbollah also targeted a Jewish community center in a devastating bombing in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1994, two years after Nasrallah had become the leader of the terrorist organization in 1993.

    "author": "Breitbart News",
    "content": "SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — A New Mexico judge on Monday upheld an involuntary manslaughter conviction against a movie armorer in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer by Alec Baldwin on the set of the Western film “Rust.” Armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed asked a court to dismiss her involuntary manslaughter conviction or convene a new trial in the shooting death, alleging misconduct and suppression of evidence by law enforcement. Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer halted and ended Baldwin’s trial in July based on misconduct of police and prosecutors and their withholding evidence from the defense in the 2021 shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set outside Santa Fe. Gutierrez-Reed was convicted by a jury in March in a trial overseen by Marlowe Sommer, who later sentenced her to the maximum 18-month penalty. Gutierrez-Reed already has an appeal of her involuntary manslaughter conviction pending in a higher court. Prosecutors blamed Gutierrez-Reed for unwittingly bringing live ammunition onto the set of “Rust” and for failing to follow basic gun safety protocols. Gutierrez-Reed’s attorneys argued that her case should be reconsidered because prosecutors failed to share evidence that might have been exculpatory. She was acquitted at trial of allegations she tampered with evidence in the “Rust” investigation. Gutierrez-Reed also has pleaded not guilty to a separate felony charge that she allegedly carried a gun into a bar in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where firearms are prohibited. A proposed plea agreement is awaiting court review. Baldwin, the lead actor and co-producer for “Rust,” was pointing a gun at Hutchins during a rehearsal on a movie set outside Santa Fe in October 2021 when the revolver went off, killing Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza.",

    "title": "Report: Senate Democrats Say Nuking Filibuster over Abortion Is Worth the Risk",
    "author": "Katherine Hamilton",
    "content": "Several Senate Democrats are joining Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris in her call to end the filibuster in order to pass legislation that would federalize abortion and wipe out pro-life state laws. Nuking the filibuster would drop the 60 required votes to pass legislation in the U.S. Senate to just 51 votes, a move some Democrats told the Hill may be “worth the risk” should they maintain control of the Senate and gain control of the House and presidency in 2025. While some Senate Democrats are wary of what Republicans could achieve without the filibuster if they were to eventually gain back control, they said lowering the threshold would enable the codification of “abortion rights” and “other key legislative priorities,” the report published on Sunday states. “There’s real risk anytime there’s debate about rules and procedures in the Senate. It becomes very bitter,” Sen. Peter Welch (D-VT) told the outlet. “So yes, there is risk.” “The other problem is there’s risk in having a Senate that’s more dedicated to rules and procedures than it is to getting things done,” Welch continued. “It’s very dangerous for the Senate as an institution to simply not address extraordinarily important issues like reproductive freedom, like voting rights.” Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) agreed on potential long-term problems with scrapping the filibuster but emphasized that Democrats have no choice because the current setup is hampering their ability to enact their agenda. “As far as I’m concerned, we should be discussing the rules going forward. We’re now in a dystopian situation in the Senate where we do very little, if any, legislating,” Durbin said. Vice President Harris brought the filibuster debate to the forefront again after she called for its end during an appearance on Wisconsin Public Radio on last week to supposedly restore Roe v. Wade. “I think we should eliminate the filibuster for Roe,” Harris said. “To actually put back in law the protections for reproductive freedom and for the ability of every person and every woman to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them what to do.” Her call to end the filibuster is the furthest she has gone in her pledge to federalize abortion if she is elected in November. Harris has repeatedly said she would sign legislation to restore Roe v. Wade, which the Supreme Court overturned in 2022, and has made killing unborn babies in abortions central to her campaign. She has repeatedly refused to cite abortion restrictions she would support and falsely claimed that abortions do not happen later in pregnancy. Harris has previously called to end the filibuster but for a different reason. During her 2020 presidential campaign, she said she would back ending the filibuster to pass the radical Green New Deal, which is essentially a far-left socialist wishlist. National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) Chairman Steve Daines (R-MT) warned in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News in July that the Democrats have “radical” power-grabbing plans for the United States, which include ending the filibuster if they hold the majority in the upper chamber of Congress. Daines specifically warned that ending the filibuster would allow Democrats to ram through their radical agenda, including packing the U.S. Supreme Court to 13 justices instead of nine, making Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico states to add four Democrat U.S. senators to the Senate, and conducting a federal takeover of election operations everywhere in the country. “The consequences of losing right now are profound because, if we don’t take back the majority and the Democrats are in charge, they will blow up the filibuster,” Daines told Breitbart News D.C. Bureau Chief Matthew Boyle. Daines continued: That means D.C. and Puerto Rico are now states. That means four Democrat senators in perpetuity. They will also move the Supreme Court from nine to 13 Justices. They will pack the court. And last, they will pass one of their favorite bills — the left — and that’s the federal takeover of all the elections. Our Founding Fathers feared concentration of power. That’s one of the things about the separation of powers both in terms of the three branches of government but also the separation of powers between the federal government and the states, the principles of federalism. This bill would remove any voter ID laws that states have passed. It would be all mail-in ballots. They would have cutoffs on Tuesday night on election night at maybe 8:00 p.m. and have a long tail of maybe two weeks to get all the ballots in. You can see, we lose complete control of elections, and the left does irreparable harm to this country with a power grab that would make it very difficult to ever get a center-right government elected in Washington again. As Boyle reported, the only thing that stopped Democrats from ending the filibuster in the last two Congresses is that two senators, who now claim to be independents and have since left the Democratic Party, refused to go along with this strategy. He wrote: Those two senators, Sens. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, are both not running for reelection this cycle. Despite leaving the Democrat Party, they did not join the Republicans and still caucus with Democrats. But, since both are leaving the U.S. Senate, Daines warns that if Democrats hold the majority, there will be no dissenting voices left inside the Democrat Party to stop them from going through with their radical power grab plans. Daines points to a written plan from Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the Democrat candidate for U.S. Senate in California this year, who explicitly made these goals clear in what Schiff calls the interest of protecting “democracy.” Daines said that since Sinema and Manchin have both announced their retirements, “there are no more Democrats that are going to stand to protect the filibuster.” “…[W]hich means it’s a simple 50-vote-plus-one threshold to put these radical changes into our laws, including — imagine the Second Amendment and the gun-grabbing legislation they would pass with just 51 votes,” Daines said. “By the way, don’t believe me: Go read what Adam Schiff has written. It’s a sad report, but Adam Schiff is probably going to be the next U.S. senator from California,” he continued. “He telegraphed this in writing earlier this year. So, that’s their strategy. We cannot let them succeed, and that’s why we have to get at least 51 Republicans in the United States Senate in January of 2025.” Democrats’ path to power is not so clean cut, the Hill reported, noting that its forecast with Decision Desk HQ shows Republicans having a 70 percent chance of winning back the Senate majority. Even so, many are encouraged by the fact that Sens. Sinema and Manchin will not be there to thwart their goal of altering the filibuster, the report reads. “We would have Roe v. Wade as law of the land, comprehensive immigration reform, better gun safety laws,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). “And we’d just be warming up.”",

    "title": "Powell Touts Strong Economy Even While Indicating More Rate Cuts Ahead",
    "author": "John Carney",
    "content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reaffirmed on Monday that he views the U.S. economy as fundamentally strong, even as the central bank made a surprising move to cut interest rates earlier this month. Speaking at the annual meeting of the National Association for Business Economics in Nashville, Powell sought to explain the Fed’s decision to lower rates while expressing confidence in the economy’s resilience. “We have made a good deal of progress toward our goal of reducing inflation without a painful rise in unemployment,” Powell said, signaling that the Fed remains committed to what economists often call a “soft landing” for the economy. The rate cut, a half-point reduction that brought the Fed’s policy rate to a range of 4.75 to 5 percent, was unexpected given the Fed’s repeated assertions of economic strength. Powell portrayed the move as a calculated effort to maintain momentum in the labor market while continuing to bring inflation down toward the central bank’s target of 2 percent. Still, the decision has raised questions about the Fed’s strategy, particularly as Powell himself acknowledged the underlying robustness of the economy. The divergence between the Fed’s rhetoric of strength and its actions of easing monetary policy has left some market participants and analysts wondering whether the central bank is responding to concerns not yet fully visible in the data. While Powell sidestepped specific questions about whether future rate cuts would be 25 or 50 basis points, he emphasized that decisions would be made “meeting by meeting,” allowing the Fed flexibility to react to changing economic conditions. The central bank is aiming to bring rates down to a “neutral” level—estimated around 3 percent—where monetary policy neither stimulates nor restricts growth. At present, the Fed views its policy rate as still somewhat restrictive, dampening economic demand. Yet some economists point to the resilience of financial markets—marked by five straight months of gains in the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average—as evidence that the economy may not be as vulnerable as the Fed suggests. In the coming weeks, markets will be focused on upcoming jobs reports, which Powell indicated would play a crucial role in shaping the Fed’s next moves. Stronger-than-expected job growth could lead to a smaller 25-basis-point rate cut, while weaker labor data might push the Fed to take more aggressive action, with another 50-basis-point reduction. The balancing act the Fed faces—cutting rates while signaling confidence in economic growth—reflects the challenge of managing an economy that has thus far defied expectations. Powell’s optimism on Monday, juxtaposed with the Fed’s latest moves, leaves open the question of whether the central bank is anticipating a slowdown that has yet to materialize",

    "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
    "content": "The Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) reportedly pulled back from Lebanon’s border with Israel, as Israel began shelling Hezbollah positions ahead of a ground assault on Monday night. As Breitbart News reported, citing other media reports, Israel had informed the U.S. of its plans for a “limited” ground operation in Lebanon to remove Hezbollah outposts. Reports circulated Monday that the LAF and UNIFIL had withdrawn. The Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that the LAF had begun repositioning its forces in response to information about Israeli troop movements from the U.S. There were also unconfirmed reports that UNIFIL, which is meant to enforce United Nations Security Council resolutions against Hezbollah’s presence near the border, but has failed to do so, also withdrew from some positions. The Times of Israel reported that there was “heavy” Israeli shelling reported near a Lebanese border town. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) declared the area around Israel’s northernmost border communities to be a closed military zone. The Israel Defense Forces declared the area around Metula, Kfar Giladi, and Misgav Am to be a closed military zone as of Sep. 30, 2024. Geographic place names are indicated in Hebrew. (IDF) White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Monday afternoon that the Biden administration understood that Israel’s strategic purpose was “to make sure that Hezbollah cannot maintain the capacity to attack Israeli communities from the immediate opposite side of the border.” She reiterated President Joe Biden’s call for a ceasefire. Update: The IDF’s Arabic spokesperson, Avihay Adraee, posted maps of buildings in Beirut, Lebanon’s capital city, that he said local residents should avoid: IDF Spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari asked Israelis not to share reports about troop movements and to await official reports: Update: UNIFIL later denied that it was repositioning in response to Israel’s entry on the ground in Lebanon.

The infant — whose age and sex are not immediately known or have not been released — was found “just before 10 a.m. inside the restroom at Sophie’s Cuban Cuisine,” law enforcement and sources said. The eatery is located in Manhattan’s Financial District, on Fulton Street near Gold Street downtown. Police responded to a 911 call, and when they arrived, they found the baby unresponsive and unconscious, authorities said. EMS workers pronounced the baby dead at the scene, according to the report.

    "title": "VIDEO: Father Walks Nearly 30 Miles Through Flood Hazards to Attend Daughter’s Wedding",
    "author": "Amy Furr",
    "content": "One father’s love for his child shone brightly during his arduous journey through areas devastated in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. When David Jones set out on a two-hour drive from South Carolina to Johnson City, Tennessee, for his daughter’s wedding, he was determined to get there, WJHL reported Monday. His journey ended up being seven hours in his car and over five hours on foot. Jones crossed the Tennessee state line around 2:00 a.m. and learned the roads were impassable. But his daughter’s wedding was at 11:00 a.m. and he was going to walk her down the aisle, no matter what lay ahead. Therefore, he decided to walk the approximately 30 miles to his destination. The hurricane that hit Florida on Thursday was deemed a Category 4 storm and was later downgraded as it moved over the southeast United States, Breitbart News reported on Monday. The storm knocked out power, washed bridges away, and stranded people with floodwaters. Jones had to walk in complete darkness carrying only his cellphone as a light while picking his way around hazards such as mud, huge piles of debris, broken fences, and downed trees. At one point, he got stuck in mud and was nearly hit by a backhoe as it was clearing a road but managed to escape in time. For extra safety, he carried a reflective stake so cars would avoid hitting him. Jones eventually got help from a driver he knew who drove him the final few miles to his daughter’s wedding. An image shows the pair on her wedding day: “That’s so emotionally moving [to know] that my dad loves me that much, that he’ll come and go through all of that to get to my wedding and be there on time,” said Elizabeth Marquez, who had no idea about her father’s journey until later. Jones later gave the newlyweds a special gift. “I brought the reflector to the reception, and I presented it to Elizabeth, my daughter, and Daniel just for them to remember, to be a protector and a good reflection of each other and a reflection of God,” he said. As cleanup continues, stories have emerged of heroic Americans who have endured the storm. In Tennessee, people living near the Nolichucky River recently cleared a bridge to rescue others trapped by floodwaters, according to Breitbart News.",

    "title": "Tim Walz Bragged of Mass Immigration Overwhelming Small Minnesota Town’s Schools with 50 Languages: ‘Beautiful Diversity’",
    "author": "John Binder",
    "content": "Gov. Tim Walz (D), Vice President Kamala Harris’s running mate, once bragged about mass immigration overwhelming a small town in southern Minnesota — calling the situation an example of “beautiful diversity.” In late 2019, Breitbart News reported extensively on Worthington, Minnesota. With fewer than 14,000 residents, the town’s taxpayers were forced to hike taxes to the sum of tens of millions to expand the school district because of a rapid increase in migrant children enrolling. Much of that mass immigration in Worthington is the result of the federal government’s Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) program and the fact that a JBS Pork slaughterhouse attracts newly arrived migrants to the area. During a gubernatorial debate in October 2022, Walz bragged about the mass immigration that has inundated Worthington for decades now — spinning it as a positive thing that several dozen languages are now spoken in the town’s schools. “We are a state of immigrants that values that. We have more refugees per capita than any other state. That’s not just morally a good thing — it’s our economic and cultural future,” Walz said: This beautiful diversity we see out in Worthington when I’m there, you see 50 languages spoken in the school and you see every storefront filled with different types of foods, different types of businesses that are happening. Minnesota needs to continue to do that. The Office of Governor can set the tone on that. [Emphasis added] Worthington, since the year 2000, has seen its foreign-born population balloon to almost 30 percent of the town’s population. About 24 years ago, the town’s foreign-born population was half what it is today. Minnesota is one of several states spending billions to teach American English to newly arrived migrant children enrolled in its school districts. With more than 75,000 English learners, Minnesota taxpayers paid nearly $1.2 billion to fund its English as a Second Language (ESL) program in 2020. In June, a statewide look at Minnesota’s public schools revealed alarming trends. From 2019 to 2022, the percentage of fourth graders in the state who are not proficient in reading has increased from 62 percent to almost 70 percent. Likewise, eighth graders not proficient in math increased from 56 percent in 2019 to nearly 70 percent in 2022. Perhaps most alarming, almost a third of all students in the state were deemed “chronically absent” in the 2021-2022 school year, meaning they missed 10 percent or more school days.

    "author": "Warner Todd Huston",
    "content": "A man who won a guitar signed by Taylor Swift at a Texas charity event smashed the instrument to pieces right on stage after winning the item and the video of his gleeful act has gone viral. The video appears to have been recorded at the Ellis County Wild Game Dinner held near Dallas, Texas, over the weekend and the guitar was certified as having being signed by the pop mega star, TMZ reported. The video starts with the emcee holding a hammer in one hand and the guitar on another as the man assumed to be the winner of the auction comes to collect his prize. But as he approaches, he grabs both the hammer and the guitar and instantly starts bashing the guitar to pieces as the crowd laughs and cheers. Since the emcee already had the hammer ready for action, it is obvious that the whole point of the auction was to destroy the Taylor Swift item. According to TMZ, the guitar was donated to the charity auction by a third party, not Swift herself. The Ellis County Wild Game Dinner is a non-profit organization that supports agricultural education for kids. Swift has been a particular target of criticism from the political right for years, but especially after her endorsement of Kamala Harris for president.

    "title": "Utah Mom Fundraises for Her Own Funeral After Rare Cancer Diagnosis",
    "author": "Olivia Rondeau",
    "content": "A Utah mom has been forced to fundraise to plan her own funeral and support her two young children after being diagnosed with a rare, aggressive form of cancer. Erika Diarte-Carr, a 33-year-old single mother to Jeremiah, 7, and Aaliyah, 5, made a desperate plea on GoFundMe to raise $5,000 after receiving bad news from her doctor: On May 7th, 2022, the day before Mother’s Day, I walked into the emergency room due to what I thought to be just a normal shoulder injury and walked out diagnosed with stage 4 terminal cancer along with the doctor’s words replaying in my head, “I hope you have a good support system at home because you’re going to need it, you have a long and hard journey ahead of you.” The doctor then proceeded to tell me that there were multiple tumors that had metastasized to other parts of my body including my skeletal, which is how we were able to find the tumor that was causing my shoulder pain. By that point the damage had already been done. In that moment, mine and my kids’ entire lives had changed forever, as well as all of those around us. On top of her shock diagnosis with stage 4 small cell lung carcinoma, Diarte-Carr also found out she had Cushing Syndrome in January 2024 —- which led to several other issues like dramatic weight gain, swelling, deterioration of her muscles and bones, diabetes, and “so much more!” After receiving her diagnosis, the hardworking mom still managed to maintain a full-time job and parent her children. “I do have an AMAZING support system but over time it has put a major financial, emotional, mental and physical toll on us all,” she noted. As if she was not already going through enough hardship, a September 18 update from her oncologist revealed that the situation was even more dire than previously thought. “Due to my prognosis, I have decided to discontinue treatments as they will no longer help. I have been given 3 months to live. 3 months to spend with my babies and loved ones. 3 months to make the best of what time I have left,” Diarte-Carr wrote in an update on GoFundMe. “During these next couple of months I need to make sure my kids will be ok after I am gone. I am faced now with the most difficult thing of planning my own funeral.” As her condition worsened she eventually had to stop working, and found herself in a financial pit. “I do not have any finances saved up or any life insurance set aside for this situation,” the mom wrote. “I have looked into the expenses and I am needing to raise about $5,000 to ensure funeral costs are covered plus I’m wanting to leave something behind for my babies.” She added in her plea that while it was “hard for me to put my personal business out there today and to finally ask for help,” she had to do it for her children. Since creating the fundraiser after her original diagnosis, Diarte-Carr received a lot of support from those in her community. Since finding out she only has three months to live, the page has raised over $1 million. “All the funds that have exceeded my funeral cost will be now put into a trust fund for my babies,” the mom wrote in an update. “That way, I can leave behind something for them and I can still ensure they are going to be ok as they grow up.” “They are my whole life, light and soul. My children are my fight and what keep me going.” In an interview with ABC4 after the fundraiser blew up, she said, “It happened overnight. I never expected that.” “I never expected to have a big funeral service, or a lot of people reach out and help me. With the way it’s went, I’m just in shock … just very grateful for everybody and everything that’s been there.”",

    "title": "‘SOS Mode:’ Nationwide Verizon Cell Outage Impacts Millions of Americans",
    "author": "Alana Mastrangelo",
    "content": "Verizon suffered a nationwide outage on Monday morning, leaving millions of customers across the U.S. in SOS mode, unable to send and receive calls or text messages all morning and afternoon — with no end in sight for those still impacted. The outage appeared to kick in at around 9:30 a.m. EST with Verizon customers flooding DownDetector — a site that monitors tech issues — to report their cell service being stuck in SOS mode, while others noted they had bars, but were unable to send and receive calls or texts. By 10:15 a.m. EST, more than 100,000 customers reported Verizon outages with DownDetector, which suggests that the outage has impacted many more across the country. While Verizon has 114.2 million U.S. users, the amount of people impacted by the outage remains unclear. The issue also appears to be nationwide, with customers reporting problems everywhere from New York to California. “In Miami. Still SOS since 11 AM EST,” one customer reported. “No voice/text/data since this morning in Mid-Michigan,” another revealed. “I’m in Dallas,” another disclosed. “Started with just no incoming calls around 8:45am CT. then progressed to no outgoing calls an hour or so later. Now I’m unable to receive texts.” Similar reports from customers across the country flooded into DownDetector. As the day went on, Verizon customers became increasingly furious with the phone provider, expressing their dismay on DownDetector all afternoon. “This is fricken ridiculous!! I have a VERY important call coming and I can’t miss it!! Verizon get your stuff together! Ugh!! 5+ hours going now,” one customer exclaimed. “Have been down since 10:01 am in Warren, Ohio. My Husband is a Truck Driver, this is not acceptable,” another wrote. “I need my phone for work! Lost out on so much business today,” another lamented. At 3:30 p.m. EST, one customer wrote, “6 hours and counting… this is unreal,” while another commented, “Damn, didn’t expect it to be down this long.” “There’s no way this big of a company should be down for this long, I know y’all got people for this stuff,” another surmised. “Should we start looking for a new provider?” another customer asked. Verizon addressed the issue in a Monday morning X post, writing, “We are aware of an issue impacting service for some customers. Our engineers are engaged and we are working quickly to identify and solve the issue.” It remains unclear, however, when Verizon customers can expect their cell service to return to normal.

Tim Walz (D-MN) are set to square off in the lone vice-presidential debate Tuesday. “This is” JD Vance, Surabian wrote in his post, adding the hashtag “#HillbillyEnergy” — a play on Vance’s bestseller Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis. In the two-minute video featuring a previous interview from Vance, the 40-year-old populist notes that many feel as though the American Dream is becoming progressively out of reach before reflecting on his own upbringing in Middletown, Ohio, during the 1990s: The world I grew up in was one where I think for the first time really in American history, you know, my parents generation did not expect their children to necessarily have a better life than they did. And you saw that in all kinds of different ways, but there was this sense of growing up in Middletown in the 1990s that a lot of people didn’t expect the future to be better than the past, and that’s a really unique and a really tragic thing. While jobs left Middletown, once a dominant manufacturing city in the nation, drugs and “hopelessness” became prominent, Vance said. WATCH — Vance: Media, Harris Campaign Have Been “Calling the Residents of Springfield Racists”: “I wrote Hillbilly Elegy because I wanted to give people a sense of what it was like to live in a community like mine. I didn’t think a whole lot of stories were told about white working-class Americans,” he said. “I didn’t think a lot of stores were told about people who were struggling with some of the problems we were struggling with: joblessness, drug addiction, so forth,” he continued. “And I thought that I could tell a story that would make people understand my family a little bit better and maybe, in the process, understand the struggles of a lot of families.” Vance adds that the nation must begin electing officials who actually hail from the communities they want to represent in Washington, DC. “I come from the places that I want to represent, and what we need is to stop sending people who are of the D.C. swamp. We need to send people who are of the places they aim to represent,” he concluded.",

    "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
    "content": "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) will begin a “limited” ground war in southern Lebanon to remove Hezbollah bases near the border with Israel, according to multiple reports. As Breitbart News reported Saturday, the IDF has already reportedly sent commando units into Lebanon on small missions to destroy Hezbollah positions. And as Breitbart News reported in April, the IDF had already been carrying out similar missions for several months. Now, however, with the senior leadership of Hezbollah dead, and the terror group’s communications destroyed, the IDF is reportedly planning a larger operation, and Israel’s security cabinet met Monday to consider options. The Times of Israel reported Monday that the U.S. State Department confirmed that Israel had informed it of its battle plans: Israel has informed the US about a series of limited ground operations into Lebanon that it is planning, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller says. “We have been engaged in conversations with them about those operations, but the timing, purpose, tempo of those — I’ll let them speak to,” Miller says, during a press briefing. “They have informed us about a number of operations. They have at this time, told us that those are limited operations focused on Hezbollah infrastructure near the border, but we’re in continuous conversations about it,” he adds. Separately, the IDF announced that “the areas of Metula, Misgav Am, and Kfar Giladi” — a region known as the “panhandle,” which is bounded by Lebanon on both the north and the west — were now “closed military zones.” Israel’s stated goal is to return its northern residents safely to their homes, after being evacuated in October due to Hezbollah fire. Israel hopes to achieve that by enforcing United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 (2006), which calls for Hezbollah to withdraw north of the Litani River, and for it to be disarmed south of the Litani.

    "title": "Hezbollah Struggles to Replace Leaders After Devastating Israeli Strikes",
    "author": "John Hayward",
    "content": "The ruling council of Lebanon’s Hezbollah terrorist organization announced on Sunday that Hashem Safieddine, cousin of slain leader Hassan Nasrallah, has been chosen to replace him as secretary-general. Nasrallah, 64, was killed on Saturday by a precision airstrike targeting his bunker in the southern suburbs of Beirut. He was a founding member of Hezbollah in 1982, taking command of the organization after his predecessor Sayyed Abbas Musawi was killed by an Israeli helicopter raid in 1992. Nasrallah has been credited with building up Hezbollah’s terrorism capabilities and using them aggressively throughout his reign, which was certainly not a happy achievement for the people of either Lebanon or Israel, but from Hezbollah’s perspective it makes him difficult to replace. The elimination of the seemingly untouchable Nasrallah probably also reduced the number of eager applicants for his job. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu alluded to Nasrallah’s irreplaceable skill set when he said on Saturday: “As long as Nasrallah lives, he would quickly restore the capabilities we took away from Hezbollah.” Safieddine has a few important bullet points on his resume, beginning with the fact that he was one of the few high-ranking Hezbollah leaders who has not been liquidated by Israel over the past week. His familial connection and strong physical resemblance to Nasrallah are assets, and so is his tight connection to Hezbollah’s paymasters in Iran, by virtue of his son being married to the daughter of Tehran’s late terror master, Qassem Soleimani. Also, Safieddine’s brother Abdullah is Hezbollah’s “ambassador” to Iran. Safieddine has comparable Islamist credentials to Nasrallah, having studied alongside him at the Muslim religious schools in the Shiite holy cities of Qom and Najaf in Iran and Iraq, respectively. He currently leads Hezbollah’s executive council and also its “Jihad Council,” which Nasrallah established in the 1990s to coordinate attacks on Israel. He was designated a terrorist by the U.S. government in May 2017. Safieddine’s chief potential rival for secretary-general is Naim Qassem, Nasrallah’s deputy, who automatically assumed leadership duties on an interim basis until the ruling Shura Council of Hezbollah can designate a new secretary-general. Qassem, 71, also has solid credentials in both religious scholarship and political activism. He was one of the original Hezbollah religious scholars when the group was founded, having jumped ship from an older Shiite activist group in Lebanon called the Amal Movement. The Amal Movement is still around, still militant, and theoretically comparable to Hezbollah in political power, but it doesn’t have Iranian money and muscle behind it. Qassem has been Hezbollah’s deputy secretary-general for even longer than Nasrallah held the top spot. Hezbollah sources willing to speak to foreign media all seem to think Safieddine is more likely to take the top spot, because he has better Islamic religious credentials and Nasrallah was grooming him for leadership. Safieddine would provide a better sense of continuity than Qassem, which is important if Hezbollah wants to project the idea that killing Nasrallah inflicted no grievous permanent damage on the organization. “In our resistance … when any leader is martyred, another takes up the flag and goes on with new, certain, strong determination,” Safieddine himself boasted in July. Hezbollah is reportedly putting off the confirmation of a new secretary-general until after Nasrallah can receive a proper funeral, which might be tricky given Israel’s demonstrated ability to pick off Hezbollah big shots. “If you are inheriting something that has just been gutted, you are going to have to do things differently to put things back on track. Hezbollah will reconstitute, but the longer Israel keeps the pressure on, the harder it will be to do that,” national security professor Afshon Ostovar of the Naval Postgraduate School in California told the Washington Post on Saturday.",

    "title": "Donald Trump Rips Kamala Harris’s ‘FAKE and STAGED Photo’",
    "author": "Hannah Knudsen",
    "content": "Former President Donald Trump on Monday ripped Vice President Kamala Harris’s “FAKE and STAGED” photo, featuring her supposedly speaking to FEMA on the ongoing Hurricane Helene recovery efforts. “Another FAKE and STAGED photo from someone who has no clue what she is doing,” Trump said of the now viral photo, which supposedly shows Harris speaking to FEMA. One of the main issues — that countless social media users have pointed out — is that Harris’s earbuds are not even connected to her phone, as the wire seemingly drops to her lap. It is not connected to her phone, which is sitting on the table in front of her. “You have to plug the cord into the phone for it to work!” Trump pointed out, pointing to a litany of failures by the Biden-Harris administration. “Biden and Harris abandoned Americans in Afghanistan. They sacrificed Americans to an Open Border, and now, they have left Americans to drown in North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, and elsewhere in the South,” Trump exclaimed. “Under this Administration, Americans always come last, because we have ‘leaders’ who have no idea how to lead!” he added. Indeed, Harris came under fire over the weekend after Harris jetted off to Los Angeles to party with celebrities and studio executives at her glitzy fundraiser at the JW Marriott. Trump called her out, questioning how Harris could focus on that when “big parts of our Country are devastated and under water — with many people dead?” Many have called Harris out for her response to the hurricane — or lack thereof at this point, as Breitbart News detailed.

Trump also said that he has supplies for residents of North Carolina as well, and while he planned to visit the area too, he logistically cannot interrupt local responders, taking attention away from those in need.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) “I’ll be there shortly, but don’t like the reports that I’m getting about the Federal Government, and the Democrat Governor of the State, going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas,” Trump added. Authorities have confirmed at least 116 to be dead in the aftermath of the major storm.",

    "title": "Brazil Demands Twitter Pay $1.8 Million in ‘Fines’ After Elon Musk Free Speech Cave",
    "author": "Christian K. Caruzo",
    "content": "The social media platform X (formerly Twitter) must pay a fine of ten million Brazilian reais (roughly $1.84 million) to restore its services in Brazil, Supreme Federal Tribunal (STF) Minister Alexandre de Moraes announced over the weekend. The demand comes roughly one month after de Moraes, an “anti-fake news” crusader, banned access to the X platform in Brazil after it initially refused to comply with censorship orders against a group of users as well as appoint a new legal representative in the country. After initially loudly condemning the Brazilian government’s demands, X announced that it would comply with Brazilian court-mandated censorship and reinstated Rachel de Oliveira Villa as its legal representative in Brazil. Twitter reportedly submitted a formal request to de Moraes to allow for its reinstatement in Brazil following compliance with the censorship orders and other court-mandated requirements. De Moraes, in a ruling issued on Friday, confirmed that X has complied with all the censorship orders issued by the court and appointed a legal representative in the country as requested by the Brazilian top court. He, nonetheless, conditioned the reinstatement of the platform in the country to the payment of the new $1.8 million fine. The fine, according to the ruling, was imposed in response to the platform’s “failure to comply, for two days” with the ban in mid-September. On that date, users were reportedly able to access the X platform from within Brazilian territory. X described the incident as “inadvertent and temporary” and attributed it to a switch in network providers in Latin America. In addition to the $1.8 fine, the court fined the social media platform’s legal representative Rachel de Oliveira Villa 300,000 Brazilian reais (roughly $55,284). The amount, according to the ruling, stems from the accumulated sum of a daily fine of 20,000 reais (roughly $3,656) imposed on the legal representative in mid-August at a time when the X platform was in defiance of the court’s orders. “According to the ruling, made in Petition (PET) 12404, X proved that it had fully complied with two requirements for the resumption of activities: the blocking of profiles and the appointment of a legal representative of the company in the country,” the STF announced. “However, it has yet to prove payment of the fines for non-compliance with the decisions.” The ruling stated that the STF ordered the Central Bank of Brazil to block the accounts of the X social media platform and its legal representatives, asserting that “no amounts were found sufficient to guarantee” the payment of Oliveira Villa’s fine in her accounts. The court demanded X inform if it will use the amounts the court order blocked to pay the fine and withdraw appeals filed against both the initial ban and the fines. “The end of the suspension of the operation of the X platform in national territory and, consequently, the immediate return of its activities depend solely on full compliance with Brazilian legislation,  the ruling read, “and absolute observance of the decisions of the judiciary, in respect for national sovereignty.” X’s compliance with de Moraes’ censorship orders comes after a months-long feud between de Moraes and X owner Elon Musk directly, following Musk’s initial refusal to comply with the censorship orders. Musk accused the judge of rigging the 2022 Brazilian election, which far-left President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva narrowly won against then-incumbent conservative President Jair Bolsonaro. During Brazil’s 2022 presidential campaign, de Moraes imposed censorship orders on Bolsonaro’s campaign, banning it from describing Lula as a “thief” or “criminal” in reference to his multiple convictions on corruption charges. De Moraes has spearheaded a widespread, years-long censorship campaign against conservative Brazilian citizens, politicians, journalists, and comedians supportive of Bolsonaro. He has ordered police raids and arrests of these individuals, as well as the removal of their social media accounts across several platforms such as X, Facebook, YouTube, or Instagram. Some have also had their bank accounts frozen. Last week, during his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Lula appeared to defend the censorship of conservative figures in Brazil, referring to it as necessary for “the defense of democracy.” RELATED — Don Lemon: Elon Musk ‘Seemed Really Averse to Facts’ Christian K.

Notably, Sorokin — who was released from prison in 2021 after being convicted in 2019 of grand larceny in the second degree, attempted grand larceny, and theft of services — was the first contestant to be voted out of Season 33’s Dancing With The Stars. Sorokin made her Dancing With The Stars debut on September 17, performing the cha-cha with her professional partner, Ezra Sosa. There wasn’t a public vote during week one of the show, but Sorokin went on to be the first contestant eliminated that following week, on September 24. After being voted out and asked by the show’s co-host Julianne Hough, “What are you going to take away from this competition?” Sorokin replied with just one word: “Nothing.” Watch Below: Sorokin’s one-word quip went on to become a viral online meme.

Now, as the mother of a black 6-[foot], 2-[inch] son, we know he’s going to send those police officers into black and brown communities and migrant communities.

If a person is watching these violent movies and he’s talking about Hannibal Lecter and he’s talking about the night of broken glass, he’s in a dark place and he has a very dark vision of America.

    "title": "Nolte: Disgraced Jussie Smollett Still Claims to Be Victim of ‘MAGA Country!’ Trumpers",
    "author": "John Nolte",
    "content": "The dumber-than-dumb People Magazine offered convicted hate-hoaxster Jussie Smollett an unchallenged environment to continue to spread his ugly and divisive hoax. On January 29, 2019 — more than five freaken years ago — Smollett claimed he was the victim of a hate crime perpetrated by two white men at 2 A.M. in a freezing cold Chicago. The disgraced Empire star told the police (and the world) that these men asked if he was “that faggot Empire ni**er,” before beating him, looping a noose around his neck, and pouring bleach on him. Oh, and then they shouted, “This is MAGA country!” Gee, how lucky were these guys to be so prepared for a hate crime at 2 A.M. in an icy cold Chicago? Of course, it was a hoax. Police say Smollett invented the whole thing for attention and to get a bump in his Empire salary. Instead, he was fired by Empire and ultimately convicted of five counts of felony disorderly conduct. This came with a $130,160 fine and a 150-day jail sentence. He served only six days before being released on appeal in March of 2024. If his conviction is not overturned, Smollett may have to finish those other 144 days, which this entitled, spoiled brat deserves. Smollett is 42 years old and instead of admitting he did something stupid, that he regrets it, and serve his time, he continues to this very day to stand by and be defined by a reprehensible lie. Here he is in the latest People: Despite the narrative he says so many have assumed, Smollett maintains his innocence to this day. “I was numb,” he says, recalling the incident to PEOPLE. “I didn’t know how to connect the dots. I really genuinely did not know. I couldn’t make sense of what was going on, and I couldn’t make sense of what people were actually thinking … what exactly do they think happened? I couldn’t put two and two together.” There’s absolutely no journalism here. Why not ask him why his two black friends claim Smollett paid them to beat him up on the street posing as two Trump supporters? Challenge him a little bit. Instead, he’s allowed to pose as a victim and spout this nonsense: “I have a more adult grown-up way of talking about it now, but at the same time, my views have not changed,” he says, adding that he now approaches things with a “gentler” touch. “My heart has not shifted at all. I’m the same man that I was and will always be this way. If tons of people are listening to you, you should say something worth them hearing.” Smollett appears to have found a second career producing and directing TV movies about gay men for BET. Good for him. No one wants to deny him a living. We all deserve a second chance. But this guy does not deserve forgiveness or to be allowed to move on until he admits what he did and asks for forgiveness. The egomaniac is not contrite at all. He’s still spreading his toxic lie, which makes him a disgrace. Living a lie is exhausting. Most of us learn that as kids. Fess up. Get it behind you. Move on. Life is so much simpler that way. John Nolte’s first and last novel, Borrowed Time, is winning five-star raves from everyday readers. You can read an excerpt here and an in-depth review here. Also available in hardcover and on Kindle and Audiobook.",

    "content": "Vice President Kamala Harris was panned by critics for posting a seemingly staged photo to her official vice president X account of her responding to Hurricane Helene, a storm which has devastated cities across the southeast and killed more than 100 people. In the photo, which is of her aboard Air Force Two, shows her writing and wearing Apple earbuds with a cord. The photo was posted Sunday evening, presumably on her return to Washington after a weekend of fundraising for her presidential campaign. Critics, however, panned the photo as fake, highlighting that nothing can be seen on the paper she is writing on, and that her earbuds’ cord is not plugged into her iPhone in front of her. Author Hans Mahncke posted, “Fake imagery is all they have.” Writer Jeff Carlson posted: Everything about you is fake. Phone unplugged. Blank paper. On a flight to your next fundraiser. All a metaphor for your candidacy. Just a hollow shell of staged photo ops. News outlet The Quartering posted: Blank paper, headphones not plugged into anything. Literally NOTHING you do is real Buzz Anderson, former Air Force pilot and author posted: Ear buds in but unplugged from her phone. Blank paper in front of her. Empty brain. The Harris campaign in a snapshot. Harris spent the weekend fundraising in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas, returning Sunday in the aftermath of the hurricane, which has reportedly killed more than 100 across the southeast. Meanwhile, Trump announced on Monday that he would be heading to Georgia to survey the damage and bring aid. He said he also wanted to stop in North Carolina but did not want to distract from relief efforts there. He posted on Truth Social: We are now heading to Valdosta, Georgia, in order to pay my respects and bring lots of relief material, including fuel, equipment, water, and other things, to the State. Many politicians and Law Enforcement will be there. We’ll be saying hello to Franklin Graham, Burt Jones, Tyler Harper, Mike Collins, Austin Scott, Russ Goodman, Sam Watson, and the Mayor of Valdosta Scott James. They are working very hard. I was also going to stop into North Carolina, which has really been hit hard. I have a lot of supplies ready for them, but access and communication is now restricted, and we want to make sure that Local Emergency Management is able to focus on helping the people most affected, and not being concerned with me. I’ll be there shortly, but don’t like the reports that I’m getting about the Federal Government, and the Democrat Governor of the State, going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas. MAGA!",

    "author": "Breitbart News",
    "content": "Breitbart News’s AWR Hawkins received the Second Amendment ‘Lifetime Achievement Award’ from the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms (CCRKBA) at the 39th Annual Gun Rights Policy Conference over the weekend. Hawkins has written over 16,600 articles during his 14+ years at Breitbart, working each day not simply to report on the Second Amendment but to educate and encourage Americans regarding gun rights as well. Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow commented on Hawkins’ award. “When it comes to second amendment journalism, AWR Hawkins is in a class by himself,” Marlow said. “He is quite literally a tireless defender of constitutional rights. I’m not exaggerating; he gets up in the middle of the night to get things done. You couldn’t stop him if you tried. We’re all proud of him at Breitbart News.” We asked Hawkins what the award means to him and he described it as a “tremendous honor,” adding, “It is a wild thought that getting up every day, making coffee, and sitting down to report and defend gun rights draws an accolade, particularly this accolade. I am humbled to receive the award and am thrilled to now be living in a time when the judicial tide has turned in favor of the Second Amendment.” He continued, “I look forward to continuing to write on guns and gun rights at Breitbart News and remain very proud to be part of the Breitbart team.” Hawkins was awarded CCRKBA’s ‘Journalist of the Year’ in 2015, 2017, and 2019; the ‘Gun Rights Defender of the Year‘ in 2020; and the ‘Bill of Rights‘ award in 2021.",

    "title": "Ron DeSantis Urges Federal Government to Help North Carolina: ‘We Have What We Need’",
    "author": "Hannah Knudsen",
    "content": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said on Monday that the federal government should focus on helping the people in North Carolina in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. Speaking on the storm efforts on Monday, DeSantis said he was flying when President Joe Biden called him, so he was not able to speak with him. “What I would say is … Florida — we have it handled, we got approved for the individual assistance, things we’ve wanted. We have what we need now — obviously, you know, there may be additional things that we’ll ask for in the future,” DeSantis said, explaining that it depends on “how things shake out.” “But I think most of the effort should be in western North Carolina right now, because you still have active rescues that need to take place,” DeSantis said, pointing relief efforts that way. “I mean, just think about it; it’s almost like if this area were totally cut off and every road was destroyed and all this, but you can still get places by boat — there you can’t do that … and I just think they should really — the federal government should focus on that,” the Florida governor said. “We’re running rescue flights. We’re happy to do it, but I know the federal government has more assets than the state of Florida has, so there should not be anybody left behind,” he added. WATCH: DeSantis’s remark comes as Harris receives backlash for largely ignoring the devastating impact of Hurricane Helene, which ravaged not only Florida and Georgia, but also western North Carolina. Over the weekend, Harris opted to party with celebrities and studio executives at her glitzy fundraiser at the JW Marriott in downtown Los Angeles on Sunday afternoon. As Breitbart News detailed: Among those in attendance at Sunday’s Harris-Walz Hollywood fundraiser were Demi Lovato, Stevie Wonder, Jessica Alba, Lily Tomlin, and Sterling K. Brown, according to multiple reports. Former Disney chief and Democrat fundraiser Jeffrey Katzenberg was there, as were Universal boss Donna Langley and Hollywood PR maven Kelly Bush Novak. The shindig reportedly raised more than $28 million for the Harris-Walz campaign. Kamala Harris spent the weekend rubbing elbows with celebrities as millions of Americans in the southeast continued to pull themselves out of the destruction caused by Hurricane Helene. President Joe Biden told reporters that the federal government won’t be giving people affected by the hurricane any more federal resources. She was also ripped for posting a staged photo: RELATED — Spicy Brandon! Joe Biden Gets Testy with Reporter over Question on Hurricane Helene Response\nVideo Source: White House Even former President Donald Trump, who headed to Valdosta, Georgia, on Monday to deliver relief items, called Harris out. “Why is Lyin’ Kamala Harris in San Francisco, a City that she has totally destroyed, at fundraising events, when big parts of our Country are devastated and under water – with many people dead?” Trump asked on Sunday. Trump also explained on Monday that he planned to visit North Carolina as well and has “a lot of supplies ready for them.” “But access and communication is now restricted, and we want to make sure that Local Emergency Management is able to focus on helping the people most affected, and not being concerned with me. I’ll be there shortly, but don’t like the reports that I’m getting about the Federal Government, and the Democrat Governor of the State, going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas,” Trump added.

    "title": "Exclusive — Donald Trump: Kamala Harris Would ‘Decimate’ Social Security and Medicare; ‘They’re Going to Be Destroyed’ If She Wins",
    "author": "Matthew Boyle",
    "content": "Former President Donald Trump told Breitbart News exclusively that Vice President Kamala Harris would “decimate” Social Security and Medicare if she won the election, and the only way to protect those programs is to vote for him. Asked during a nearly hour-long interview last weekend about Democrats privately sounding the alarm about Harris’s silence on Social Security and Medicare as Politico reported earlier in September, Trump sounded off, saying she avoids talking about the programs because people know her policies would destroy them. “So she doesn’t talk at all about Social Security or Medicare because everyone knows she’s going to decimate them,” Trump told Breitbart News. “They’re going to be destroyed. There’s no way to fix it once she does that. There’s no way anybody could pay for it because she’s putting migrants in there at levels nobody has ever seen. She is destroying Social Security and Medicare. She won’t bring it up because she can’t justify it. She can’t answer the question.” Politico reported, in the wake of the Teamsters union refusing to endorse Harris as polling of its members shows large-scale support for Trump, that Democrats are worried about Harris’s lack of focus on the issues of Social Security and Medicare. An anonymous elected Democrat in Pennsylvania is quoted by Politico saying that this Democrat is “worried about her with” seniors. “Most of all, I just think they don’t know her,” the anonymously quoted Pennsylvania Democrat said. “She should be coming in on Medicare and Social Security like non-fucking-stop.” Trump told Breitbart News that Harris’s essentially policy-free campaign shows a lack of substance or seriousness on major issues, including most importantly immigration and the impact it has on programs like these and on public safety. Trump again noted how unserious Harris was, too, in her interview with Oprah Winfrey recently. “She can’t answer almost any question on almost any subject,” Trump said. “She’s destroying our country. The hardest question for her is: ‘Why have you allowed 21 million people into this country, many of them criminals and terrorists? Why have you done that?’ She could not answer the question. She couldn’t answer any question on Oprah.” Trump also explained that the vast majority of Teamsters members are supportive of him. Trump’s support among working-class voters is at record levels for a modern Republican, per CNN’s Harry Enten: In fact, as Breitbart News has reported, the Teamsters’ own polling shows Harris trailing Trump in all 50 states among its members—including significant leads for Trump in battleground states. “The members are actually in revolt because they’re saying, ‘Wait a minute, Trump won with approximately 60 percent of the vote. Why haven’t we endorsed him? Why haven’t we endorsed Trump?’ Her number was down in the 30s,” Trump said. “They don’t know who she is or where she is. I watched the Oprah show and every answer was an embarrassment. It was almost like she has a very small reel of answers and she just uses them no matter what question is asked. If she meets with President Xi or with Putin or all these people, this country is going to be destroyed. If she wins and has to meet with these people, they will never have been so lucky.” When Breitbart News pointed out to Trump a previous story this outlet published that recounted how Harris’s answers to three different questions about the Israeli war in Gaza in three different settings were nearly identical and robotic, Trump laughed and said: “She’s got no vocabulary. It’s unbelievable if you look at it.” Trump also said Harris’s appearance on Oprah was “the weirdest” thing he has seen recently, and reiterated he thinks Harris has “something wrong with her.” “I actually think there’s something wrong with her, and we can’t take a chance,” Trump said. “We’ve gone through four years of that and she and everybody else lied about his cognitive health. We cannot have four more years of that.” Trump of course would later, while at a campaign event this weekend in Wisconsin, note that while Biden became impaired mentally, “Kamala was born that way.”",

    "title": "Nolte: Kamala Harris Has Absolutely No Idea How a Bill Becomes a Law",
    "author": "John Nolte",
    "content": "During a friendly interview with the All the Smoke podcast, sitting Vice President Kamala Harris proved she has no idea how a bill becomes a law. What we have here is another situation where Kamala is interviewed by her own fans and asked puffball questions in the hopes of making her look good and in command. Unfortunately for her, she’s an idiot with no grasp of why she believes what she believes, and your only takeaway from the interview is how dumb and shallow she is. One of the hosts offered her this layup: “Explain how a bill becomes a law.” What happened next was pure comedy, a skit involving a dumb person speaking like they believe smart people talk. This is really something: I believe that the best way the system works is when the power is with the people, to then advocate for their [sic] and have their needs met. So that’s the big macro stepping back, right? One of the ways the system works to do that—that the system should work to do that, is we have elected representation who represent the people in these state legislatures, which is where laws get passed. Or in Congress, which is where the federal laws get passed. And for the system to work the right way, legislators, these members of the state legislature, let’s say it’s a state senator, state assemblymember, or your congressman or your United States Senator, will meet with and they’ll have ways of receiving information from the people about what they want. I think it’s really important always that we know our power to organize around what we need, and sometimes that will take the form of writing letters, sometimes it will take the form of mass protests to make sure the voice of the people is heard by their representative leaders who then have as their responsibility to write up some legislation that meets the needs of the people. And then when they write that up, they take a vote in their body, if it’s a statehouse or Congress, and if the majority of the people there agree with it, it becomes a law. So that’s how it’s supposed to work, and I mean it does connect to what we were talking about earlier which is then reminding folks they have a right and a right to expect that their leaders will hear them and take seriously their needs. No. That’s not how it works. And if you watch the video, you can see her spouting all this nonsense to stall for time in the hope the real answer comes to her. She forgot all about the executive branch. Nothing becomes a law until a governor or U.S. president signs it. Yes, both legislative bodies have to pass it with a majority, but it then goes to the executive branch in the form of a governor or president for final approval. It is the executive branch’s approval that finally turns a bill into a law. This woman was a U.S. Senator. How can she not know this? This woman is a sitting vice president. How can she not know this? This woman is running for president. How can she not know this? Does she even know the office she is running for? Kamala and I are only a year apart, which means we both had access to the same Saturday morning cartoons… Duh: What was she doing on Saturday mornings? We know she wasn’t reading or working at McDonald’s. What a dummy this woman is — much dumber than I thought. John Nolte’s first and last novel, Borrowed Time, is winning five-star raves from everyday readers. You can read an excerpt here and an in-depth review here. Also available in hardcover and on Kindle and Audiobook.",

    "title": "Communist Nicaragua Demands ‘Climate Justice’ from ‘Greedy Slavers’ at U.N.",
    "author": "Christian K. Caruzo",
    "content": "Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Valdrack Ludwing Jaentschke declared that Nicaragua is “one” with other rogue regimes around the world such as Cuba, Venezuela, Russia, and China in his ideological speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Monday morning. Jaentschke, recently appointed by communist dictator Daniel Ortega as his communist regime’s top diplomat this month, described his country as “blessed, dignified, always sovereign, Christian, socialist, and solidarity inspired.” The minister sent an “embrace to everyone in the world who wants peace,” presenting a differing image from that of the authoritarian communist regime he represents, which boasts a deplorable track record of human rights violations against dissidents and brutal persecution of Christianity: In addition to pledging Nicaragua’s support for other like-minded rogue regimes, Jaentschke spent much of his address denouncing war as a “savage method of imperialism” and labeling capitalism “savage, barbaric and fierce,” leading to the extinction of all living beings. Jaentschke claimed the values of “love, fraternity, and hope” are victims of a “Hell” marketed as “paradise” by “Satanic majesties.” The Ortega regime representative also condemned Israel “and its First World allies” for its alleged “genocide” in Gaza and Lebanon – and against “so many other valiant, brave, and dignified peoples that do not subordinate themselves to brutality.” “We are not silent, and we will not be silent. We denounce and condemn the aggression against Syria, Iran, and so many other great and combative brothers and sisters on all continents,” Jaentschke said. The minister also denounced a purported “systematic policy of extermination of cultures and rights” allegedly committed by “colonialists and imperialists powers” against the rogue Latin American regimes of Cuba, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Nicaragua that form part of the ALBA “anti-imperialist” far-left regional bloc. “Nothing is free in this world. We must grow in consciousness and heart every day, absolutely lucid, absolutely clear, absolutely convinced and consistent, because only the unity of the peoples of the planet will stop the imperialists of the Earth,” Jaentschke said. The minister then declared that, as part of ALBA, his country is “one” with Venezuela’s late socialist dictator Hugo Chávez and his successor Nicolás Maduro, as well as Cuba and its communist Castro regime, Bolivia and its “much-respected ways,” and Russia in its “great battles against bestial fascism.” Jaentschke also made special note of China, which expanded its control of Nicaraguan natural resources such as gold at an accelerated pace through hastily prepared loans and agreements signed under the auspices of dictator Ortega. “We are one with the People’s Republic of China that teaches us so much, transferring to us its magnificent, great Experience of building the well-being of its people, and of solidarity with the whole world, for a community of the future,” he said. The Nicaraguan foreign minister also expressed his “solidarity” with countries that are victims of alleged climate change and demanded “climate justice” from the “greedy slavers, filibusters and looters of this world.” “With everyone so, always united, we go forward to the always further on of our victorious General Augusto Sandino, and of the immortal poetry of our great Rubén Darío, and his songs of hope,” Jaentschke said before concluding his speech with by reciting a poem by Darío.

    "content": "A horrific brawl broke out at Mercedes-Benz Stadium during the Atlanta Falcons’ 26-24 win over the New Orleans Saints on Sunday. The video shows fans pushing, punching, and even stomping each other’s heads on the upper levels of the stadium in Atlanta. The fight appears to have occurred around section 321 in the upper reaches of the stands. One man is seen stomping on the head of a man who fell to the deck before a woman drags him away from the fight. The man whose head was stomped does not appear conscious after being stomped. WATCH: Another video from a different angle shows more of the melee. A post shared by Mann Stalls (@og_manndagreat) Unfortunately, that was not the only upper-deck brawl on Sunday. A video shows two other young fans fighting as well. Fights between NFL fans seem to be a weekly occurrence during football season.

    "title": "Pollak: Seven Questions to Expect from the VP Debate",
    "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
    "content": "Sen. JD Vance (R-OH) and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D), the running mates for former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, respectively, will debate on Tuesday night on CBS News at 9:00 p.m. Eastern time. Here are five questions to expect — either because the moderators will ask them, or because the candidates will raise them (the debate rules prohibit asking each other questions, as with the presidential debate, but it happened anyway). 1. Vance will have to explain his “childless cat ladies” remark. Vance made the comment in 2021, before he became a U.S. Senator, during an interview with Tucker Carlson. His point was that liberal elites are making policies for other Americans without anything at stake. But he will have to explain the remark, which Democrats have used to portray him as insensitive to women, and to families that do not follow a traditional model, for whatever reason. 2. Walz will have to explain his long history of ties to China. The ABC News moderators did not bother to ask about China during the presidential debate. so Vance might have to bring up the topic on his own. Walz has a particular case to answer: he traveled to China extensively over the years, and has been accused of unusual warmth toward the communist regime. It is unclear why he is obsessed with China, and what that means for the country. 3. Vance will have to explain the “dogs and cats” controversy. The town of Springfield, Ohio, has been in the news because of the migration of vast numbers of Haitians — and because of accusations, later found to be without foundation, that the migrants have been eating people’s pets. The moderators are certain to repeat questions Vance has faced from interviewers over the past few weeks about whether he and Trump are drumming up racial prejudice. 4. Walz will have to explain his exaggerations about his military service. Vance has repeatedly pointed out that Walz embellished his record as a National Guard reservist: he falsely claimed to have carried a gun in combat; he falsely claimed to have served in Afghanistan; and he falsely claimed to have retired as a command sergeant major. Walz has responded poorly to this question on the rare occasions when he has been asked about it by journalists. 5. Vance will have to explain his past opposition to Trump. Democrats love to note that Vance said some of the same things about Trump once upon a time that they say today. His answer has been that he changed his mind based on Trump’s performance in office, and of course Trump knew Vance’s history when he named him his running mate. Still, Walz will enjoy telling America that “even” Trump’s running mate didn’t like him. Vance needs answer. 6. Walz will have to explain his poor performance as governor. The media have praised Walz, but have ignored his record, because it’s bad. Under Walz, Minnesota is basically a cold version of California. Its economy lags behind the rest of the country; residents are leaving, but foreign migrants are flooding in; violent crime has risen; education has fallen; and Walz is trying to end fossil fuels. It’s also a “sanctuary” for transgender surgery for minors. 7. Both candidates will have to explain what makes them ready to serve as president, if needed. Walz is a hitherto obscure governor; Vance is in his first term in the Senate. Both have served in the military; Walz was also a teacher, and Vance also had a career in venture capital. But both have been primarily focused on attacking the other side in the election, rather than on their cown redentials. Both must show they are ready to be commander-in-chief. Joel B.

Now, the 21-year-old explains why he suddenly quit the pros: He’s quitting to follow Jesus. Griffin played in 92 games and averaged 7.5 points and 17.1 minutes per game during his short NBA career with the Hawks. But just as he prepared to play for the Houston Rockets this season, he announced his retirement. Fox News reported that Griffin has told fans in a YouTube video that he is putting his faith in Jesus ahead of basketball. “I gave up basketball to follow Jesus,” the now-former player said. “And I know that in a lot of people’s eyes, that seems like, it seems like a loss in the world’s eyes. But I just want to let you guys know that I’m super excited because I truly get to serve God, you know, with my full Yes, and I feel like letting go of basketball is allowing me to, you know, go into full-time ministry and truly serving the Lord with all my heart — with all my time too, as well. So, I’m just excited to see where that leads me.” Griffin says that he gave his “full life to Christ” in 2020 and now feels compelled to devote his entire attention to his religion. He feels he was being called to let go of basketball to serve the Lord. He also cites Matthew 10:39, which says, “He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for my sake will find it.” Griffin’s buyout opens a roster spot for the Rockets, though the team already has an impressive line-up. They could even leave the spot empty just for a little flexibility for trading later in the season.

    "title": "Nolte: Trump Increases Lead over Harris in North Carolina",
    "author": "John Nolte",
    "content": "With a presidential race this close, the smallest movement in the polling feels seismic. In this particular North Carolina poll, former President Trump led by a single point last month. Today, he leads by two points. It’s enough to drive you to drink. East Carolina U polled 1,005 likely North Carolina voters between September 23-26 and found Trump leading sitting Vice President Kamala Harris by two points, 49 to 47 percent. At the end of August, Trump led by a single point, 48 to 47 percent. WATCH — CNN’s Tapper: Harris Took a Different Border Stance When She Thought It Was Politically Beneficial to Do So: In the RealClearPolitics average poll of North Carolina state polls, Trump leads by a meager 0.6 points. However, in 2016, on this same day, Trump led Hillary Clinton by an average of 0.3 points. He would go on to win the state by a fairly comfortable margin of 3.6 points. Also, on this same day in 2020, Joe Biden led in North Carolina by an average of 0.5 points. Trump would go on to win the state by 1.3 points. Looking at the overall polling during the weekend and today, Trump has a little wind at his back. Of the 11 most recent polls out of Pennsylvania, the state could very well decide the election.  Harris has only led in one. Trump has led in four. Six are tied — which is pretty incredible. WATCH — Crowds Gather Outside Pennsylvania Grocery Store to See Trump: There’s no doubt Harris had a terrible weekend, which is not yet reflected in the polls. Her inane decision to visit the southern border after four years of ignoring it, an act that only drew attention to her biggest political weakness, will be remembered as a fatal error should she lose the election. Additionally, on top of Kamala’s Dukakis-style border visit, America was hit with the news that up to 650,000 of the ten-plus million migrants the Biden-Harris administration has allowed into the country are criminals and criminal suspects. More than 13,000 are murderers on the loose. Trump wasn’t lying when he said foreign countries are opening up their prisons and sending the bad guys into Kamala’s America, where they are welcomed with free rent, free healthcare, and a monthly allowance. Real Americans should have it so good. It will also be interesting to see how the Biden-Harris administration’s lack of action regarding the flooding here in Western North Carolina plays out with voters. New York or Washington, DC, get two inches of snow and it leads the national news for days. Our little towns have been ravaged or wiped out entirely. Where the hell is everyone? John Nolte’s first and last novel, Borrowed Time, is winning five-star raves from everyday readers. You can read an excerpt here and an in-depth review here. Also available in hardcover and on Kindle and Audiobook.",

    "title": "Electric Time Bomb: Tesla Bursts into Flames Inside Garage Flooded by Hurricane Helene",
    "author": "Lucas Nolan",
    "content": "A Tesla electric vehicle caught fire while parked inside a garage that was flooded with saltwater from Hurricane Helene in Florida, prompting officials to issue warnings to EV owners in storm-affected areas. WFLA reports that dramatic surveillance footage released by Pinellas County authorities in Florida shows the moment a parked Tesla spontaneously burst into flames inside a garage that had been inundated by floodwaters from Hurricane Helene. The video reveals how the fire originated underneath the electric vehicle and rapidly spread, completely engulfing the car in flames within a span of just one minute as thick, billowing smoke filled the cluttered garage space. The alarming incident occurred after Hurricane Helene battered Florida and other southeastern states like North Carolina, causing extensive flooding in many areas. In response to the Tesla fire, Pinellas County officials took to Facebook to share the video footage and caution owners of electric vehicles about the potential risks associated with water damage from the hurricane. “Electric Vehicles that have been flooded in saltwater can catch fire,” the Pinellas County Government warned in their Facebook post on Saturday. “If you evacuated and left an electric vehicle or golf cart in your garage or under a building and you are not able to get to it or move it, we want you to let us know.” Authorities further advised EV owners to take necessary precautions to prevent similar fire hazards. They strongly recommended against charging, driving, or storing electric vehicles and e-bikes inside homes or garages if the vehicles had been exposed to saltwater flooding. The county stressed that any flooded electric vehicle should be moved at least 50 feet away from flammable materials and towed to a dealership for a thorough safety inspection before attempting to operate it again. Breitbart News has previously reported on the dangers of EV batteries impacted by salt water. In 2022, Florida Chief Financial Officer and State Fire Marshal Jimmy Patronis wrote an urgent letter to the NHTSA seeking guidance on how to deal with the threat of EV fires caused by stormwater: “The State Fire Marshal’s Office is in need of immediate guidance regarding the response to fires produced by electric vehicles (EVs) that are compromised as a result of lithium batteries corroding from exposure to salt water,” Patronis said in his letter. Last week, electric vehicles were seen catching on fire in Florida after becoming waterlogged during Hurricane Ian, giving firefighters “a new challenge” they “haven’t faced before,” Patronis said. “I joined North Collier Fire Rescue to assess response activities related to Hurricane Ian and saw with my own eyes an EV continuously ignite, and continually reignite, as fireteams doused the vehicle with tens-of-thousands of gallons of water,” Patronis continued in his letter to the NHTSA.

    "title": "Gavin Newsom Signs Bill Barring Local Authorities from Requiring Voter ID",
    "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
    "content": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill Sunday that will bar local authorities from requiring photo ID to vote, which exceeds the state’s requirements. California is one of 14 Democrat-run states that do not require any ID to vote, despite requiring it for many other purposes. Voters at polling places are checked off against voter rolls without further proof being required; voters who submit mail-in ballots must include their signatures on the envelopes that are checked by a machine against the signatures on file in voter registration records. The City of Huntington Beach, one of the last conservative bastions in the state, which often opposes Democratic policies, planned to require photo ID for voting in 2024, after a ballot initiative passed to that effect in March. The new law, SB 1174, “would prohibit a local government from enacting or enforcing any charter provision, ordinance, or regulation requiring a person to present identification for the purpose of voting or submitting a ballot at any polling place, vote center, or other location where ballots are cast or submitted, as specified.” The text of the law also claims, without evidence: “Voter identification laws have historically been used to disenfranchise low-income voters, voters of color, voters with disabilities, and senior voters.”\nPolitico reported on the new law, and another that bans local authorities from prohibiting vote-counting machines: The legislation — from state Sen. Dave Min, an Orange County Democrat running for Rep. Katie Porter’s open House seat — is a direct response to a controversial ballot measure approved this year by voters in Huntington Beach requiring people to show photo identification at the polls. It will take effect on Jan. 1. … Legislation from state Sen. Steve Bradford, signed into law Wednesday, clarifies record-keeping procedures for secure elections data and increases the secretary of state’s regulatory power over poll books and other voting systems used in local elections. Ultraconservative local officials in Shasta County unsuccessfully attempted to dump electionic voting machines last year, citing baseless concerns of voter fraud. Their arguments mimicked claims about voting machines made by former President Donald Trump following the 2020 presidential election. California is certain to support Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential election, but there are several close congressional races in the state that could have a significant impact on the balance of power in Washington.

    "author": "Hannah Knudsen",
    "content": "Former President Donald Trump is on his way to Valdosta, Georgia, to bring “lots of relief material” to victims of Hurricane Helene, explaining that he plans to go to North Carolina as well, but he first wants to make sure that local emergency management is focusing on helping the people most affected and “not concerned with me.” “We are now heading to Valdosta, Georgia, in order to pay my respects and bring lots of relief material, including fuel, equipment, water, and other things, to the State,” Trump said in a Truth Social post Monday, previewing some of the other notable individuals who will be there. WATCH — Spicy Brandon! Joe Biden Gets Testy with Reporter over Question on Hurricane Helene Response: “Many politicians and Law Enforcement will be there. We’ll be saying hello to Franklin Graham, Burt Jones, Tyler Harper, Mike Collins, Austin Scott, Russ Goodman, Sam Watson, and the Mayor of Valdosta Scott James. They are working very hard,” Trump continued, explaining that he plans to visit North Carolina very soon, but has not been able to yet logistically, as he does not want to take attention away from local officials who are helping the people affected by the storm. “I was also going to stop into North Carolina, which has really been hit hard. I have a lot of supplies ready for them, but access and communication is now restricted, and we want to make sure that Local Emergency Management is able to focus on helping the people most affected, and not being concerned with me,” Trump explained. “I’ll be there shortly, but don’t like the reports that I’m getting about the Federal Government, and the Democrat Governor of the State, going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas. MAGA!” Indeed, the Trump campaign announced the former president will visit Valdosta on Monday in the aftermath of the hurricane — a great contrast to Vice President Kamala Harris, who has been mocked for posting a staged photo talking to FEMA, as many pointed out that her earbuds were not even connected to her phone. Many on social media blasted the response of the Biden-Harris administration — or complete lack thereof. Trump also had something to say about it on Sunday, asking on Truth Social, “Why is Lyin’ Kamala Harris in San Francisco, a City that she has totally destroyed, at fundraising events, when big parts of our Country are devastated and under water — with many people dead?” WATCH — Aftermath: Aerial Footage Seen of Tampa Area After Hurricane Helene Passed Through: Many have been making comparisons to the train derailment that affected East Palestine, Ohio, as it was Trump who arrived before the Biden administration, comforting residents and bringing them supplies.

    "title": "Investigators: Department of Veterans Affairs Staffers ‘Improperly Accessed’ Vance and Walz’s Medical Records",
    "author": "Amy Furr",
    "content": "Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) workers are accused of improperly accessing medical records belonging to vice-presidential nominees Sen. JD Vance (R-OH) and Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN). Investigators say at least a dozen employees “improperly accessed” the records over the summer, an alleged move that would violate federal health privacy laws, the Washington Post reported Monday. The outlet continued: VA officials notified the Vance and Walz campaigns about the breaches after discovering the unauthorized viewing by employees at the agency’s massive health care arm, the Veterans Health Administration, according to people familiar with the investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the ongoing investigation. Now, investigators are trying to determine if the records were shared as they probe the motives behind the alleged breach. “Some employees told investigators that they were simply curious to see Walz and Vance’s medical records, as both nominees’ military service has faced scrutiny during the presidential campaign,” the Post article read. WATCH — Maher on Walz Saying He Carried Weapons in War: Walz Is “a Huge Liar Like All Politicians Are”: In August, Vance, who is a U.S. Marine veteran, criticized Walz for lying about his military service, according to Breitbart News. The article said Vance highlighted the fact that “Walz — a retired Army National Guard sergeant major — not only dropped out of the Army before his unit deployed to Iraq, but has lied about his military service, claiming that he carried weapons ‘in war’ — when he never served in combat or war.” The Minnesota National Guard has since revealed that Walz had his rank reduced to master sergeant the day before he retired, “which means that he never retired as a command sergeant major as he has claimed numerous times in political ads and in political settings,” Breitbart News reported on August 17. Vance and Walz are scheduled to debate on Tuesday as the 2024 presidential election intensifies and as Americans get ready to vote in November, the Associated Press (AP) reported on Sunday.",

Why is that? Why is the Democratic share of the Latino vote shrinking?” Hinojosa said, “What I said to you when we asked the question was, Latinos want to be white.

He is such a good businessman.’ It’s like, no, he’s not. He had bankruptcies. But they don’t want to be identified with all of those other immigrants that Donald Trump speaks so badly of, including me as a Mexican immigrant, so they’re like, ‘Let’s be with him.’ Those numbers, they could cost Kamala Harris the election.

    "title": "U.S. Airstrikes Kill 37 Islamic State and Al-Qaeda Terrorists in Syria",
    "author": "John Hayward",
    "content": "The U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) said on Sunday that two targeted airstrikes in Syria eliminated 37 terrorists aligned with the Islamic State and al-Qaeda, including several senior leaders. CENTCOM revealed the first of the previously undisclosed airstrikes was conducted on September 16 on a “remote ISIS training camp in central Syria.” At least 28 ISIS operatives were killed, including four “senior leaders.” “The airstrike will disrupt ISIS’ capability to conduct operations against U.S. interests, as well as our allies and partners,” CENTCOM said. On September 24, a second targeted strike in northwestern Syria killed “nine terrorist operatives” of a group called Hurras al-Din, including a senior leader called Marwan Bassam. “Hurras al-Din is an al-Qaeda-affiliated organization based in Syria with global aspirations to conduct attacks against U.S. and Western interests,” CENTCOM explained. Hurras al-Din is the successor to the infamous Nusrah Front as the leading al-Qaeda franchise in Syria. The Nusrah Front broke away from al-Qaeda’s control in 2018, absorbing several smaller Syrian rebel militias that were reluctant to join al-Qaeda and renaming itself Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). Hardcore al-Qaeda loyalists in the Nusrah Front created a new group called Hurras al-Din, which found itself struggling to survive against Western counter-terrorist operations, the Syrian government, and HTS, which decided to eliminate any threat posed by its former Nusrah Front comrades. HTS and Hurras al-Din members have been known to abduct and kill each other over the past six years as they struggle for influence and resources. In August, the U.S. military eliminated Hurras al-Din leader Abu-Abd al-Rahman al-Makki with a “targeted kinetic strike” in Syria. Al-Makki was the operational commander of the group’s terrorist activities in Syria. CENTCOM’s statement on Sunday said there was “no indication any civilians were harmed” in either the September 16 or September 24 strikes.",

    "author": "Dylan Gwinn",
    "content": "It has been nearly a week since Caitlin Clark’s season ended, only two games into the WNBA playoffs. However, she’s still getting cheered. On Sunday, the WNBA superstar appeared on the jumbotron at the Colts-Steelers game in Indianapolis during a feature called, Who ya Got? In which fans are asked to side with the “haters” or another hometown favorite. The crowd then cheers or boos according to their preferences. Unsurprisingly, when Caitlin Clark was featured, the crowd made their preference well known. Caitlin Clark gaining instant recognition on a jumbotron—even if it’s in the city she plays in—is an achievement that deserves recognition. The number of WNBA players in history who have instant facial recognition by fans without prompting is extremely small. Her rookie season, however, raised not only her own profile but also that of a league that had previously been little more than an afterthought in the minds of American sports fans. Clark eclipsed records for the most points scored by a rookie in WNBA history, the all-time scoring record for a point guard, the new mark for most assists in a single game, the record for most assists in a single season by any WNBA player, and the rookie record for the number of triple-doubles in a season. She also passed Diana Taurasi for second place for the most made three-pointers by any player in a season. And that’s not even mentioning her impact on team and league merchandising, attendance, and viewership. The Colts beat the Steelers 27-24.",

    "author": "Breitbart London",
    "content": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) – Russia fired missiles and drones at 11 regions of Ukraine, the Ukrainian air force said Monday, in a 33rd consecutive night of aerial attacks behind the front line and set a new monthly record of drone barrages. In Kyiv, multiple explosions and machine gun fire could be heard throughout the night as the Ukrainian capital´s air defenses fought off a drone attack for five hours. No casualties were reported in Kyiv or elsewhere, though a “critical infrastructure object” caught fire in the southern Mykolaiv region, Gov. Vitalii Kim said, without elaborating. Russia has increasingly deployed Shahed drones, rather than more expensive missiles, in its aerial bombardment of Ukrainian cities since its full-scale invasion of its neighbor in February 2022. It launched more than 1,300 Shahed drones at Ukraine in September alone – the highest number of drone attacks in a single month since the war began. Ukraine, too, has developed a new generation of drones for the battlefield and for long-range strikes deep inside Russia. More than 100 Ukrainian drones were shot down over Russia on Sunday, Russian officials said. Also Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin released a video marking the second anniversary of the annexation of four Ukrainian territories and again accused the West of turning Ukraine into “a military base aimed at Russia.” Putin was speaking to mark the annexation of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine after a referendum held in 2022 which was denounced by the West as a sham. Russia also illegally annexed Crimea in 2014. Since 2022, Putin said, businesses in the occupied areas are being “actively restored” and hospitals and schools are being rebuilt. Thousands of Ukrainians fled from the four regions as a result of Russia´s invasion, but Putin said Russia´s military operation in the country was to defend residents´ “well-being” and the “future for our children and grandchildren.”",

    "title": "Gavin Newsom Signs Bill Requiring Health Insurance to Cover IVF",
    "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
    "content": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) signed a bill Sunday requiring major health insurance companies in the state to cover in vitro fertilization (IVF), a move that was deliberately aimed at affecting the national presidential election. IVF is an experimental treatment once used in rare cases to help couples struggling with infertility. It has now become more popular as an option for women who want to delay pregnancy, or raise children on their own. It is, however, very expensive. Few insurance policies cover IVF, due to the cost, though there is ample anecdotal evidence of women taking short-term jobs at the few companies, like Amazon.com, that offer to cover IVF as part of benefit packages. The bill, SB 729, “would require large and small group health care service plan contracts and disability insurance policies issued, amended, or renewed on or after July 1, 2025, to provide coverage for the diagnosis and treatment of infertility and fertility services. With respect to large group health care service plan contracts and disability insurance policies, the bill would require coverage for a maximum of 3 completed oocyte retrievals, as specified. The bill would revise the definition of infertility, and would remove the exclusion of in vitro fertilization from coverage.” The bill also requires the state to compensate local governments and school districts for the new costs it imposes; it does not make any determination about what to do if IVF coverage makes health insurance more costly in the private sector. In a statement, Newsom said: “California is a proud reproductive freedom state – and that includes increasing access to fertility services that help those who want to start a family. As Republicans across the country continue to claw back rights and block access to IVF – all while calling themselves ‘the party of families’ – we are proud to help every Californian make their own choices about the family they want.” He did not provide evidence for his claims. President Donald Trump has said, often, that he supports IVF. Democrats claim that Republicans want to end IVF. They cited a controversy in Alabama, where many health care providers suspended IVF treatments after the state’s highest court ruled that IVF embryos were human beings for the purposes of a wrongful death civil lawsuit. Some conservatives have raised ethical questions about what happens to embryos that are frozen or destroyed without developing into human beings. And Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance (R-OH), has expressed support for the traditional family model of raising children. However, there is no Republican effort to block access to IVF. Joel B.

A reporter asked Biden, “On the hurricane, Mr. President, why weren’t you and Vice President Harris here in Washington commanding this this weekend?” Biden snapped at the reporter, “I was commanding, I was on the phone for at least two hours yesterday and the day before as well.

    "author": "Hannah Knudsen",
    "content": "Democrats have “just bout slit your throat” and “threw you on the ditch,” Republican Michigan Senate candidate Mike Rogers said during an appearance on Breitbart News Daily, discussing the impact Democrat policies have had on factory workers in the state. Host Mike Slater mentioned an MSNBC union town hall featuring union members, noting that half of them said they were not even paying attention to the presidential election. However, there were still a few supporters of Vice President Kamala Harris, so Slater asked the GOP hopeful, “How do you talk to the union guy who’s voting for Kamala?” Rogers said it is clear that union leadership is pushing the Democrat Party line, but the issue is that agenda will “put out some 400,000 Michigan manufacturing workers if they get what they want, which is all the full implementation of their EV mandates.” “It’s been devastating — 2,400 layoffs from Stellantis already. One thousands layoffs from General Motors already. The fact that Ford has announced they’re not going to go into these two SUV all-electric vehicles. So shutting those lines down, they just charged off five billion dollars in losses in their EV unit, which tells you it ain’t working,” Rogers said, noting that the Democrat politicians and bureaucrats in D.C. have forgotten one thing: “Customers.” “People just don’t want to buy them,” he said. Despite that, Democrats are doubling down. “Just about last week, all the Democrats voted — including my opponent, by the way, who’s from Michigan, who also said it’s okay to ban gas engines — to continue the EV mandate,” Rogers said. “There was a chance to stop it. And she said no. I just don’t get it. If you’re in a union shop, if you’re in a non-union shop and you’re working in a factory in Michigan, the Democrats have just about slit your throat and threw you on the ditch,” he said. LISTEN: “They’ve raised your energy prices at work. They’ve raised your energy prices for you to get to work, and when you get home, they’ve raised your energy prices there, which has increased your cost of everything that you buy — eggs and milk and bread. And now they’re saying, guess what? We’re going to send 85 percent of all the processing that happens in an electric vehicle that we’re going to mandate you buy —  [it] has to happen in China. I don’t know anyone who thinks that this is a good idea, other than the Democrats in Washington, DC,” he said. “So yeah, I don’t get it either,” he added.

    "title": "Trump Campaign Expects Tim Walz to ‘Be a Chameleon’ During VP Debate",
    "author": "Nick Gilbertson",
    "content": "Democrat Vice presidential nominee Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) will try to avoid discussing his and Vice President Kamala Harris’s “horrific radical left policies” during the vice presidential debate and instead work to paint “rosy pictures” of a future under Harris, according to the Trump campaign. Senior Trump campaign adviser Jason Miller previewed Tuesday’s debate between Walz and Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance (R-OH) during a press call with House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN). Ret. Command Sergeant Major Tom Behrends and Ret. Sergeant First Class Tom Schilling, who served in the Minnesota National Guard with Walz, were also on the call and chronicled how Walz retired after learning of an upcoming deployment to Iraq, effectively dodging the war. When asked if he thinks Walz, who has implemented radical policies in Minnesota and faces accusations of stolen valor, will work to keep the heat on himself to distract from Vice President Kamala Harris’s record, Miller said that Walz is skilled in deflecting. “Tim Walz has a challenge. I mean, he’s very good at this, as we’ve heard from Congressman Emmer and the other gentlemen who both served our country and from Minnesota, Tom Behrends and Tom Schilling,” Miller said. “Where I expect that Tim Walz is going to go is to try to kind of paint this Pollyanna picture of how great things will be under Kamala Harris,” he continued. “And I think you’re going to see Tim Walz avoid things such as their desire to ban fracking, their desire to ban gas-powered automobiles … their desire to grant amnesty to the … twenty-plus million illegal aliens that are in our country.” Miller expects Walz to “be a chameleon” on the debate stage. “As Congressman Emmer said, he’ll paint these rosy pictures of how great things are going to be, and he’ll be a chameleon,” Miller emphasized. “He’s not going to actually lay out these horrific radical left policies that both he and Kamala Harris share.” “But at a certain point here, it’s going to be tough for Tim Walz,” he added. “He’s gonna have to make a business decision up on that stage. Does he go and actually defend some of these crazy things that Kamala Harris wants to put in place, or does he just pretend that the question wasn’t asked and try to pivot to, again, one of his platitudes that we usually hear from him?” Earlier in the call, Miller predicted that Walz will portray himself differently from the “wildly gesticulating effeminate caricature” he presents at rallies. “He’ll be very well prepared for tomorrow night. He’s not going to be the wildly gesticulating effeminate caricature we see at rallies pointing to Kamala Harris dancing about on the stage. Walz is going to be buttoned-up,” Miller said, adding he will be prepared to “lie on command.” RELATED — Tom Emmer: Walz Is a Complete Disaster in Minnesota; the Folksy Guy Is an Act",

    "title": "Gallup: 80% of Key Measures Favor Republicans in 2024 Election",
    "author": "Wendell Husebo",
    "content": "Eight out of ten key measures in the 2024 presidential election cycle favor Republicans, Gallup polling found Monday. The finding suggests Republicans have a significant chance of holding the House and retaking the Senate, along with the White House. WATCH — Lindsey Graham: Kamala Harris Policies Are “Batsh-t Crazy”: Gallup measured and weighed 10 aspects of the election environment with eight of ten favoring Republicans. Two of the ten measurements that Gallup weighted as “strong” both leaned toward Republicans.\nNone favored or leaned toward Democrats, and two favored neither party. Gallup weighed the measurements that favored neither party as only “weak” and “moderate.” Decision Desk HQ predicts Republicans have a 54 percent chance of keeping control of the House chamber, which is charged with initiating revenue bills, impeaching judges and presidents, and electing a president absent an outright Electoral College victory. In the Senate, Republicans have a 70 percent chance of retaking control, according to the forecast. The Senate is important because it has the exclusive power to confirm presidential appointments, approve or reject treaties, and try cases of impeachment. WATCH — Van Jones: Trump Has “a Good Point” that Biden-Harris Didn’t Take Border “Seriously Enough”: One reason Republicans have a greater chance of flipping the Senate than keeping the House is due to the 2024 electoral map. Democrats have more swing-state seats up for reelection than Republicans. More vulnerable Democrat seats mean the party must spend more resources defending seats rather than attacking seats held by Republican senators up for reelection. A second reason Republicans have a lower chance of keeping the House is due to a reduced amount of total battleground districts up for grabs, placing greater weight on fewer races. Population shifts among partisans and subsequent redistricting within those states spawned the overall reduced number of swing districts, political experts believe.

Alright, this is union households, this is Democratic margin and presidential election. It ain’t what it used to be. You know, you go back to 1992, Bill Clinton won that union vote by 30 points. Hillary Clinton only won it by 12 points back in 2016, that was the lowest mark for a Democrat since 1984, Mondale versus Reagan.” He added, “But looked at where Kamala Harris this is today. She is only leading by nine points. That would be the worst Democratic performance in a generation. Then points off the mark of Joe Biden, who of course won four years ago. He was sort of that union guy, Union Joe, right? He won by 19 points. She’s ten points off his mark. And the worst in a generation if this, in fact holds.” Follow Pam Key on X @pamkeyNEN",

    "title": "FCC Democrats Approve ‘Unprecedented’ Soros Scheme to Control 200 Radio Stations",
    "author": "Sean Moran",
    "content": "The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Monday approved a license deal delivering leftist billionaire George Soros control over 200 Audacy radio stations; dissenting commissioners called it “unprecedented.” Breitbart News reported last week the Democrat majority at the FCC “fast-tracked” a deal to allow Soros to acquire more than 200 radio stations despite Republican objections. Soros reportedly took foreign investment to make his bid for the 200 Audacy radio stations, which covers 40 media markets, and asked the commission to make an exception to the normal review porcess. This is reportedly the first time a fast-tracked deal has gone through the commission without a typical national security review process, which normally would take up to a year or more. FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel said in a written statement on Monday: In this decision, we approve the assignment of licenses held by Audacy, which has been under the control of a bankruptcy court, to the new Audacy, so that the company can emerge from bankruptcy proceedings. The process we use to facilitate this license transfer is identical to the one recently used by the agency in the bankruptcy proceedings of Cumulus Media in 2018, iHeart Media in 2019, Liberman Television in 2019, Fusion Connect in 2019, Windstream Holdings in 2020, America-CV Station Group in 2021, and Alpha Media in 2021. To suggest otherwise is cynical and wrong, as this precedent clearly demonstrates. Our practice here and in these prior cases is designed to facilitate the prompt and orderly emergence from bankruptcy of a company that is a licensee under the Communications Act. FCC Republican-nominated commissioners slammed the decision to fast-track the order, believing it ignores the national security needs to review the deal. FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr said in a written statement: The Commission’s decision today is unprecedented. Never before has the Commission voted to approve the transfer of a broadcast license—let alone the transfer of broadcast licenses for over 200 radio stations across more than 40 markets—without following the requirements and procedures codified in federal law. Not once. And yet the Commission breaks this new ground today without seeking public comment on altering our established regulations, without actually changing the rules on the books, and without seeking the feedback of other federal agencies with relevant equities. … Federal law requires applicants with excessive foreign ownership to file a\npetition for declaratory ruling at the same time that they seek FCC approval for the relevant license\ntransfers, they must then complete that process before the FCC can approve the assignment of licenses,\nand that process must enable Executive Branch agencies with national security and specific policy\nexpertise to weigh in. Carr added, “Did they obtain approval from the FCC for their excessive foreign ownership? No, they did not. Did the Applicants afford the Executive Branch agencies with national security and relevant policy expertise an opportunity to consider their application as well as the source and amount of foreign investment? No, they did not.” FCC Commissioner Nathan Simington said in a written statement, “First, I just have to point out: a Commission eager to fast-track a billion dollar broadcast media reorganization, disregarding foreign ownership concerns, is the same Commission that has gone back to the well several times to impose and re-impose foreign sponsorship identification rules on our smallest independent broadcast license holders every time they place local church content on the air. Just saying.” Sean Moran is a policy reporter for Breitbart News. Follow him on X @SeanMoran3",

    "title": "Tom Brady Has Epic Comeback to Baker Mayfield’s Stressful Locker Room Remark",
    "author": "Dylan Gwinn",
    "content": "Baker Mayfield believes that Tom Brady created a “high-strung” work environment when he was with the Buccaneers. On Sunday, Brady made it clear he didn’t care if he stressed anyone out. In a recent podcast interview, current Bucs QB Baker Mayfield said that, although Brady’s serious style had everyone “dialed in,” he also felt the future Hall of Famer “stressed everyone out.” Brady, who broadcast the Buccaneers game against the Eagles on Sunday, addressed Mayfield’s comments during the broadcast. “I thought stressful was not having Super Bowl rings,” Brady said.”There was a mindset of a champion I took to work every day. This wasn’t daycare. If I wanted to have fun, I was gonna go to Disneyland with my kids. “There’s a way to approach this game, and it’s with the right mindset to try to push each other outside of our comfort zones, and great teammates do that. I come in, I have someone like (Rob) Gronkowski, I have someone like (Mike) Evans. There’s high expectations for us, we got to make sure we go out there and deliver.” This is precisely the response you would expect to hear from Brady. This is not to say that Mayfield cannot win a championship or lacks dedication. However, there is a world of difference between someone who would like to win a championship and someone who is consumed by an all-encompassing drive to win at all costs. Yes, there are some negative side effects from having such a mentality. Yes, that can create a high-stress environment. However, as Brady says, there is stress in not reaching optimal performance levels and not doing one’s best. Brady chose not to allow himself or his teammates to underperform, changing the game forever. What a wonderful message for all people, young and old: Don’t be afraid of stress in pursuing greatness.",

    "title": "VIDEO — The Volunteer State: Tennesseans Clear Bridge to Help People Stranded by Floodwaters",
    "author": "Amy Furr",
    "content": "Neighbors in Tennessee have once again lived up to their name as the Volunteer State by taking action after floodwaters from Hurricane Helene blocked a bridge. The deck of the Jackson Bridge was covered in debris, which made it impassable and stranded people in the areas around it, WJHL reported Sunday. Neighbors from south of the Nolichucky River used every tool they had to clear the bridge in an effort to help those living from Embreeville to South Central in Washington County. “We’ve been here all morning pushing mud, cutting trees and moving things out,” neighbor Steven Beckett said. An image shows the massive flooding: Meanwhile, Taylor Bridge had collapsed, which left people in a dire situation. One man was running low on medication for his diabetes. However, Beckett and other residents knew people like him needed help, so they got to work on the Jackson Bridge while waiting for crews who arrived later. Washington County Mayor Joe Grandy later expressed his gratitude for the neighbors who worked so hard to clear the bridge. WATCH — Aftermath: Aerial Footage Seen of Tampa Area After Hurricane Helene Passed Through: “I just want to say how impressed everyone has been with the support from the community trying to help the people that were stranded on the other side of the Nolichucky River,” he stated, later noting another group helped clear Snap Bridge Road. On Sunday evening, the Washington County Sheriff’s Office said the Jackson Bridge and Snap Bridge were open but advised people against driving to the Highway 107 area to keep it clear for recovery crews, WJHL reported. It is important to note that the state’s residents have a history of taking on difficult tasks, per the Tennessee Historical Society. “Tennessee became known as the ‘Volunteer State’ during the War of 1812 due to the key role played by volunteers from the Tennessee militia. Newspapers of the day touted the military spirit of the men of Tennessee,” the society’s website read. “That reputation was solidified in the Mexican American War of 1848, when President James K. Polk of Tennessee issued a call for 2,600 volunteers and 30,000 Tennesseans answered,” it noted.",

    "title": "Hezbollah Supporters Rally in Australia to Protest Killing of Terrorist Leaders",
    "author": "John Hayward",
    "content": "Australian police are investigating at least six instances of “prohibited symbols and chants” — specifically, chants and flags associated with the Lebanese terrorist organization Hezbollah — after pro-Palestinian groups held angry protests in Melbourne and other cities on Sunday to protest the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Thousands of protesters filled the streets at these events, waving Lebanese and Palestinian flags. The yellow flag of Hezbollah, which features an arm reaching for an assault rifle, was sighted as well. Some of the demonstrators carried framed photos of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed by a precision Israeli airstrike along with much of the group’s top leadership on Saturday. The objectionable chant was a Hezbollah slogan in Arabic that translates to: “Oh Jews, the army of Muhammad will return.” The slogan alludes to the 7th Century massacre of Jews by Islam’s Muhammad in what is now Saudi Arabia. Hezbollah is a banned terrorist organization in Australia, as in the United States and most of Europe. Hezbollah flags, symbols, and slogans are prohibited under Australia’s federal hate speech laws, with penalties of up to 12 months in jail, if they are displayed in a manner considered threatening or intimidating to others. Victoria Premier Jacinta Allan said the display of Hezbollah flags at a protest in Melbourne was “utterly unacceptable.” “This is driving deep grief and division here on the streets of Melbourne. I expect the police agencies to pursue this,” she said. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) asked the public for information about anyone “inciting violence or wearing prohibited symbols while calling for the destruction of any group or individuals.” “The AFP has no tolerance for individuals who break the law and will use its extensive capability and networks to take action,” the police statement said. The AFP added that it would be “writing to major news outlets asking for the production of video footage of protests over the weekend and protests that occur in coming days.” Foreign Minister Penny Wong said “any indication” of support for a terrorist group like Hezbollah “threatens national security” and “fuels fear and division in our communities.” “Any indication of support for a terrorist organization is unequivocally condemned,” Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said on Monday. “There is a higher level of scrutiny if anyone is on a visa. I have made clear from day one that I will consider refusing and canceling visas for anyone who seeks to incite discord in Australia,” he added. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said there were “worrying signs” of extremism in the protests over the weekend. “We do not want people to bring radical ideologies of conflict here. Multiculturalism and social cohesion cannot be taken for granted and it’s important that we continue to stress that that is the case as we go forward as well,” he said. Opposition leader Peter Dutton went further, demanding an emergency session to pass stronger anti-Hezbollah laws on Monday. “There is an absolute outrage in relation to the glorification of a terrorist leader, which surely must be against the Australian law. And if it’s not, the parliament should be recalled to pass a law that prohibits that from happening,” Dutton said. “I find it completely unacceptable that the government wouldn’t be arresting people already, or canceling visas of people who are glorifying Hezbollah and Hamas and others. They have no place in our country,” he said. “We are the greatest country in the world and we shouldn’t be afraid to defend and protect it, if Tony Burke continues to talk a big game, that’s one thing, but he needs to follow through with it,” Dutton demanded. “These are despicable and reprehensible acts to see people celebrating the life of a terrorist and promoting the values of a terrorist organization,” said shadow foreign affairs spokesman Simon Birmingham. Australian politicians have been uneasy ever since a nauseating pro-Hamas demonstration was held at the famed Sydney Opera House just days after the October 7 massacre. Government officials were excoriated for advising Jews to shelter in their homes while the streets were commandeered by pro-terrorist demonstrators. Iranian state media applauded the Australian demonstrators for expressing their “sorrow” over the “martyrdom” of Nasrallah, whose terrorist activities were lavishly supported by the regime in Tehran. “Demonstrators demanded an end to the violence in West Asia following a dramatic escalation in the fighting between the Israeli regime forces and Hezbollah for showing solidarity with and support to Palestinians since the Tel Aviv war machine unleashed its genocidal war against the besieged Gaza Strip in October,” Iran’s PressTV hyperventilated on Sunday. “Very devastated, very heartbroken, just a lot of emotion and I just felt like I had to come here today to just show my solidarity and show my respects to him and what he was fighting for,” a rally protester told PressTV. At no point did the Iranian state media outlet mention Hezbollah’s relentless missile attacks on Israeli civilians, which prompted Israel to eliminate the leadership of the Iran-backed terrorist organization.",

    "content": "MSNBC host Jen Psaki said Sunday on “Inside” that second gentleman Doug Emhoff had “reshaped the perception of masculinity.” Psaki said, “There has also been an important part, an interesting part about how people have talked about your role, how it has reshaped the perception of masculinity. I’m not sure you planned on that, but you are an incredibly supportive spouse. Has that been an evolution for you? Do you think that’s part of the role you might play as First gentleman?” Emhoff said, “It’s funny, I have started to think a lot about this. I have always been like this. My dad was like this. Too me, it is the right thing to do, you know? Support women, it’s mutual, with, and I, we support each other. We have each other’s back.” He added, “I have said many times when we lift up women, we support women, whether it is childcare, family leave, all these issues, you know, in this post Dobbs hellscape, women should not be less than, women should not be treated differently and have less rights. That’s not the American way. It’s also not like if some women succeed some dude is suffering, it’s not a one-to-one relationship. When we lift up women, we lift up families, the economy.”",

    "title": "Syria Mourns ‘Honorable’ Hezbollah Mass Murderer at U.N. General Assembly",
    "author": "Frances Martel",
    "content": "The Iran-backed dictatorship of Bashar Assad in Syria was the first state to address the United Nations General Assembly on Monday, using the opportunity to mourn the head of the Iran-backed terrorist organization Hezbollah. Hezbollah, an Iran-backed Shiite terrorist organization, confirmed the death on Saturday of leader Hassan Nasrallah, a mass murderer, following a massive Israel Defense Forces (IDF) bombardment of Hezbollah headquarters in Beirut, Lebanon. Hezbollah has targeted Israel with terrorist attacks for decades – including the deadliest terrorist attack in the history of the Western Hemisphere prior to 2001, the bombing of the Argentine-Israeli Mutual Association (AMIA) in Buenos Aires – but in the past year has dramatically escalated its activities. Following the massacre of Israeli civilians by fellow Iran-backed jihadist terror organization Hamas on October 7, 2023, Hezbollah launched a campaign against residents of northern Israel, displacing tens of thousands and limiting the Israeli government’s ability to protect the region. The strikes on its Beirut compound on Friday were a response to Hezbollah’s terrorism in northern Israel. “Israel’s war is not with you. It’s with Hezbollah,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in an address to the Lebanese people last week. “For too long, Hezbollah has been using you as human shields. It placed rockets in your living rooms and missiles in your garage. Those rockets and missiles are aimed directly at our cities, directly at our citizens.” As an Iranian proxy, Hezbollah has long enjoyed the support of the Assad regime, which relied heavily on Iranian and Russian support to remain in power through a decade of civil war. Syrian Foreign Minister Bassam Sabbagh used his address at the United Nations to mourn Nasrallah and Hezbollah’s defeat, as well as call for more opposition to Israel’s self-defense operations at the already notoriously anti-Israel venue. Sabbagh accused Israel, despite its clarifications that it is targeting Hezbollah, of waging war against “our brotherly Lebanon” by attempting to neutralize the threat of Hezbollah. “Two weeks ago, the Israeli occupation authorities committed an unprecedented crime against Lebanese by using the means of communication as a tool to kill unarmed civilians in a collective manner,” Sabbagh claimed, blaming Israel for the sudden explosion of hundreds of pagers, walkie-talkies, solar panels, and other electronics in the possession of Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon. Israel has not taken responsibility for the blasts, which killed at least 37 people, including top Hezbollah terrorists, but many reports have blamed Israeli intelligence agents for planting bombs in the devices. More recently, Sabbagh continued, Israel “targeted the southern suburb of Beirut with a treacherous and cowardly aggression destroying an entire residential block using tons of explosive bombs to assassinate Hezbollah Secretary-General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah.” The Syrian diplomat credited Nasrallah with having, “for more than three decades, led an honorable Lebanese resistance against the Israeli occupation.” “This large-scale Israeli aggression, which is unfettered by any restrictions and limitations, is pushing the region to a brink of a dangerous escalation and confrontation whose consequences cannot be predicted,” Sabbagh claimed. Contrary to Sabbagh’s depiction of Nasrallah as an “honorable” agent for political change, the Hezbollah chief was responsible for decades of Hezbollah attacks on innocent civilians around the world, including hundreds of Americans who died in Hezbollah attacks. “Hassan Nasrallah and the terrorist group he led, Hezbollah, were responsible for killing hundreds of Americans over a four-decade reign of terror,” outgoing American President Joe Biden said in a statement on Saturday following confirmation of his elimination. “His death from an Israeli airstrike is a measure of justice for his many victims, including thousands of Americans, Israelis, and Lebanese civilians.” Bashar Assad’s Syria has long maintained friendly relations with Hezbollah and other Shiite terrorist groups, relying on them for help against mostly Sunni rebel groups during much of the Syrian Civil War. The Syrian regime has also reportedly functioned as a critical diplomatic liaison for Hezbollah – for example, allegedly brokering a meeting in Damascus between Nasrallah and then Venezuelan Foreign Minister Nicolás Maduro in 2007 to facilitate the illicit issuance of legitimate Venezuelan passports to Hezbollah terrorists of Middle East origin. Elsewhere in his speech, Sabbagh accused Israel of “targeting vital civilian facilities, residential buildings, and even diplomatic premises” in Syria – an apparent reference to the bombing in April of the Iranian embassy in Damascus, which resulted in the killing of top Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) terrorist Mohammad Reza Zahedi. The IRGC, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, is a formal arm of the Iranian military. Sabbagh also condemned sanctions on Russia, Cuba, and North Korea, and declared the Assad regime’s support for the “One-China Principle,” the false Beijing claim to control the sovereign state of Taiwan. He also took special note of the alliance with Iran. “Syria expresses once again its full support to the Islamic Republic of Iran and its legitimate right to defend its national security and [to] the peaceful use of nuclear energy,” the diplomat said, “and we commend Iran’s constructive and responsible approach in this regard.” Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.",

    "title": "Kamala Harris Blasted for Hurricane Helene Response: ‘AWOL,’ ‘Pitiful’",
    "author": "Hannah Knudsen",
    "content": "Vice President Kamala Harris is facing intense scrutiny — not from the establishment media, but from Americans on social media — for her lackluster response to the damage inflicted on several states due to Hurricane Helene. Hurricane Helene made landfall as a strong Category 4 storm late Thursday in Florida’s Big Bend region. While Florida has been in recovery under the direction of Florid Gov. Ron DeSantis — who is no stranger to unleashing a strong hurricane response, swiftly restoring power, inspecting bridges, and clearing roadways in the Sunshine State — many inland and beyond were caught off guard by the mass devastation in inland areas, such as Asheville, North Carolina. According to the Associated Press, at least 30 were killed in that mountain town due to the devastation of the storm. WATCH — Aftermath: Aerial Footage Seen of Tampa Area After Hurricane Helene Passed Through: One major factor that has been on the minds of many is President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris’s response — or lack thereof. “Asheville, North Carolina. East Palestine, Ohio. Lahaina, Hawaii. The list is endless. When disaster strikes, Kamala and Biden are nowhere to be found,” RNC Research pointed out. “Hurricane Helene’s devastation is a Katrina-like disaster and our leaders are AWOL,” journalist Carmine Sabia said as others described the Biden-Harris response as “pitiful,” wondering what, exactly, she is doing. Harris’ s X account featured one photo of her supposedly on the phone with FEMA about the impacts of the storm. “I also spoke with @NC_Governor Cooper about the ongoing rescue and recovery efforts in North Carolina,” she wrote. “Our Administration will continue to stay in constant contact with state and local officials to ensure communities have the support and resources they need,” she continued, offering her “thoughts” with those who lost everything. Many were quick to mock her photo, as her headphones were not even plugged into her phone, indicating a completely staged photo. “What have you guys been doing? Because it seems like a lot of state and local officials and citizens doing the work,” one X user said. “Are we going to give them as much aid as you’ve given Ukraine?” another asked. “Since they are not Ukraine, you clearly don’t care. Same was with East Palestine, and now North Carolina,” another observed. “This photo is staged AF just like your entire campaign,” one chimed in as another added, “Under your administration, all the needs of illegals are taken care of while Americans are dying, missing, without power, and stranded on their roof, awaiting for help to arrive.” “Why is Lyin’ Kamala Harris in San Francisco, a City that she has totally destroyed, at fundraising events, when big parts of our Country are devastated and under water – with many people dead?” former President Donald Trump asked on Sunday. “She is openly acknowledged to be the Worst Vice President in History and, as President, she would be even WORSE!” he added. Trump, conversely, will be visiting the affected areas, traveling to the city of Valdosta, Georgia, on Monday, according to a press release. “President Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America, will visit Valdosta, Georgia to receive a briefing on the devastation of Hurricane Helene, facilitate the distribution of relief supplies, and deliver remarks to the press on Monday,” the Trump campaign wrote. It is reminiscent of Trump’s response — and the Biden administration’s lack thereof — after the toxic train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, as Trump showed up before the administration, comforting the people and bringing them provisions, reminding them that they were not forgotten.

    "title": "Exclusive — Michigan Senate Candidate Mike Rogers:  ‘There’s No Forward’ with Another 4 Years of Harris",
    "author": "Hannah Knudsen",
    "content": "There is no moving forward with another four years of Vice President Kamala Harris, Republican Michigan Senate candidate Mike Rogers said during an appearance on Breitbart News Daily on Friday. Rogers reacted to a clip from a town hall with a union member on MSNBC who stated that former President Donald Trump is not moving the country forward. Because of that, the man said he supports Vice President Kamala Harris. “He read the Democrat talking points before he walked in,” Rogers observed, laying out that it is actually the Democrats who have brought the country backwards. “Well, you’ve been there for four years, and you’ve just about killed us in that four years,” Rogers said of the Biden-Harris administration. “Think of this. We now import more food than we export. We build more foreign cars in America than domestic cars. Your credit card debt collectively is over a trillion dollars, which means you’re buying groceries at 23 percent, and the interest payment alone on our national debt is bigger than Department of Defense,” the Senate hopeful said. “That is what you got with Biden Harris. Why in God’s green earth we would double down on that is beyond me. There’s no ‘forward’ in that,” he said. “Those firsts are going to make America last.” Rogers also spoke about the welfare problem in America, noting that there is now what he described as “institutionalized poverty in America,” which Democrats “love.” “They love the fact that you have to wait at your mailbox for a government check that your politician says he’s going to get you another 25 cents more next year, if you only elect me. And it’s been devastating, I think, to whole classes of Americans,” he said, noting that the root of the problem for those in welfare needs to be addressed, which includes doing something about the literacy crisis. LISTEN: “My argument is, why don’t we ask these folks, ‘Hey, listen. We want to take care of you. … It’s a generous country, but you have to go through a reading assessment, and then you have to learn how to read. We’re going to take you from that fourth and sixth grade level, or even eighth grade or ninth grade level, and take you to a 12th grade level. They can do it in 6 to 14 weeks through these reading reclamation programs,” he said. He added, “And imagine what we could do, for say, if we could get everybody reading at that 12th grade level?” The literary crisis is real, he continued, and contributes to these other economic problems. “If you’re not reading in the fourth grade by the fourth grade, you have a 70 percent chance of being in prison or being on welfare. We can break that cycle. We must break that cycle,” he added. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.",

    "title": "Latino Support for Kamala Harris Drops to Historic Low for a Democrat as Donald Trump Surges Almost 20 Points",
    "author": "Wendell Husebo",
    "content": "Support among registered Latino voters for Vice President Kamala Harris dropped to the lowest level for a Democrat in four presidential cycles, while former President Donald Trump surged about 20 points, an NBC News/Telemundo/CNBC national poll found Monday. The survey highlights ongoing political realignment under Trump’s Republican party. In 2020, President Joe Biden had a 33-point advantage among Latino voters and a 38-point lead in 2016, according to NBC exit polling. In 2012, former President Barack Obama held a 44-point margin over failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney. Harris leads Trump by 14 points (54-40 percent) with 6% of Latino voters undecided, the NBC poll found. WATCH — President of Latinos for Trump in 2020: Democrats “Do Not Own Us” The political realignment under Trump is also reflected in congressional races among the Latinos, who favor Democrats over Republicans (54-42 percent), a similar decline in Democrat support relative to past election cycles. Seemingly driving Trump’s gains among the critical voting bloc are Latino men, who were split between Republicans and Democrats at 47% apiece. That’s a stark change from 2020, when Latino men favored Democrats 54% to 34%. Latina women also shifted in Trump’s direction, though still favored Democrats over Republicans 60% to 34%. For context, in 2020, Latina women hewed a lopsided 71% toward Democrats and 20% toward Republicans. … They [Latinos] favored Trump, 78, on the economy by four points, tackling inflation by nine points and addressing the border by 13 points.

    "title": "Pew: Pope Francis’ Favorability Among American Catholics Keeps Dropping",
    "author": "Thomas D. Williams, Ph.D.",
    "content": "ROME — Pope Francis’ popularity among North and South American Catholics continues to drop, the Pew Research Center revealed this past week, and nowhere more so than in his native Argentina. In the seven countries covered by the survey — Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and the United States — the pontiff’s popularity has fallen in all seven. Back in 2014, the year after his election, Francis enjoyed an impressive 98 percent favorability rating in Argentina, but his popularity has since plummeted by 24 points to a mere 74 percent. Of these, 40 percent see him “very favorably” and the remaining 34 percent see him “somewhat favorably.” Meanwhile, in neighboring Chile (where Argentineans are not particularly well liked to begin with), Francis began his pontificate with a 79 percent favorability rating, which has since declined to just 64 percent. In the United States, the pope’s favorability rating dropped by 7 percentage points between 2015 and 2021, from 90 percent to 83 percent, Pew found. More telling still, however, is that in the last 3 years his favorability rating has declined by 8 more percentage points, to a record low of 75 percent. Practicing Catholics who attend Mass at least once a week are the least supportive of him, giving him a favorability rating of just 71 percent. A mere 26 percent of all Catholics say that they view the pope “very favorably.” As a point of comparison, the favorability rating for Pope John Paul II never fell below 91 percent during his 27-year pontificate and half of Catholics viewed him “very favorably.” While the Pew Center does not offer an interpretation of Francis’ fall from favor, the president of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Right, Dr. Bill Donohue, has suggested that it is not difficult to connect the dots. Donohue, a sociologist, has noted that in the past three years the pope has endorsed civil unions and allowed the blessing of homosexual couples, leading to unprecedented pushback by clergy from all over the world. Francis also named Argentinean Cardinal Victor Manuel Fernández as head of the Vatican’s doctrinal office, despite the fact that Fernández is not known as a high-level theologian but whose claim to fame is having published a book on kissing (Heal Me With Your Mouth) as well as another book on the spirituality of orgasms (Mystical Passion: Spirituality and Sensuality), described by many as pornographic. Donohue observed that Pope Francis “allowed Fr. Marco Rupnik, a fellow Jesuit, to remain a priest in good standing, notwithstanding his being thrown out of the Society for Jesus for sacrilegious and sexual offenses.” The pope similarly “failed to deal forthrightly with his Jesuit friend, Bishop Gustavo Zanchetta, who was sentenced to prison by an Argentine court for sexually abusing seminarians,” Donohue added. Along with these disconcerting actions, Francis has put “severe restrictions on the Latin Mass,” Donohue wrote, to the chagrin of numerous faithful Catholics, and has punished conservative prelates such as Bishop Joseph Strickland of Tyler, Texas, and Cardinal Raymond Burke, former head of the Vatican’s highest court. These and other issues may help explain why the pope’s popularity continues to decline, especially among practicing Catholics, Donohue noted. Follow @tdwilliamsrome",

    "title": "Kamala Harris Partied with Hollywood Celebrities in Wake of Hurricane Helene Devastation: ‘Oh, It’s Good to Be Home!’",
    "author": "David Ng",
    "content": "Vice President Kamala Harris returned to her natural habitat over the weekend — Hollywood, where she partied with celebrities and studio executives as millions of Americans elsewhere continued to deal with the deadly devastation wrought by Hurricane Helene. “Oh, it’s good to be home!” Kamala Harris reportedly exclaimed to the crowd gathered for a Harris-Walz fundraiser at the JW Marriott in downtown Los Angeles on Sunday afternoon. Her prioritization of Hollywood stars over the millions victims of Hurricane Helene has resulted in a negative news cycle for her campaign. Former President Donald Trump is set to visit storm-ravaged parts of Georgia on Monday and will assist with the distribution of relief aid. In response, Kamala Harris cut short her fundraising tour to head back to Washington, D.C. Monday morning. Among those in attendance at Sunday’s Harris-Walz Hollywood fundraiser were Demi Lovato, Stevie Wonder, Jessica Alba, Lily Tomlin, and Sterling K. Brown, according to multiple reports. Former Disney chief and Democrat fundraiser Jeffrey Katzenberg was there as were Universal boss Donna Langley and Hollywood PR maven Kelly Bush Novak. The shindig reportedly raised more than $28 million for the Harris-Walz campaign. Kamala Harris spent the weekend rubbing elbows with celebrities as millions of Americans in the southeast continued to pull themselves out of the destruction caused by Hurricane Helene. President Joe Biden told reporters that the federal government won’t be giving people affected by the hurricane anymore federal resources. Hollywood celebrities have served as a reliable source of cash for Kamala Harris throughout her political career, which began in California. After Biden dropped out of the race this summer, following the massive coverup of his cognitive decline, celebrities went all-in for Kamala, showering her campaign with millions of dollars. But as ordinary Americans continue to suffer due to record-high consumer prices, one of Kamala Harris’ biggest media allies is sounding the alarm about her coziness with wealthy stars. NBC News ran an article last week in which it cautioned the party might be making a big mistake this election year. “The courting of celebrity endorsements is a long-running tradition in presidential politics and one that Democrats generally win,” NBC News reporter Matt Dixon noted. “But in the process, Democrats can open themselves up to an easy line of attack from Republicans: Democrats cater to Hollywood, not average Americans.” Follow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg.

    "title": "Netflix Cancelations Spiked After CEO Reed Hastings Pledged Millions to Kamala Harris",
    "author": "Alana Mastrangelo",
    "content": "Netflix cancelations have reportedly spiked after the streaming platform’s CEO Reed Hastings announced he’d donate millions to Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign. Netflix’s rate of cancelations nearly tripled in the United States after supporters of former President Donald Trump called for action against the streaming giant following its CEO’s donation to Harris, according to a report by Bloomberg. While U.S. consumers were already canceling their Netflix subscriptions at a higher rate than usual in July — in large part due to the company’s decision to phase out its cheapest, advertising-free tier — the five-day period after Hastings endorsed Harris saw “unusual” numbers of cancelation, “even for July,” the outlet noted. On July 23, the Netflix CEO endorsed Harris in an X post, writing, “Congrats to Kamala Harris — now it is time to win.” Hastings’ congratulatory remark was in reference to President Joe Biden having recently ended his reelection campaign — after being ousted by his own Party — making Harris the soon-to-be Democrat Party nominee. After issuing his congratulatory X post, Hastings told The Information that he donated $7 million to a pro-Harris super PAC. After that, Trump supporters began calling on customers to end their subscriptions alongside the hashtag #CancelNetflix. Then, on July 26 — three days after Hastings’ donation to the pro-Harris super PAC became public — Netflix experienced the single worst day of cancellations this year, Bloomberg noted. This is not the first time Netflix was hit with a wave of cancelations as a result of the streaming service’s behavior. In 2020, the streaming giant’s cancelations surged in reaction to the film, Cuties, which generated a firestorm over its highly sexualized depiction of underage girls. In recent years, conservatives have found that boycotts can actually work. Last summer, sales of Bud Light beer tanked after transgender influencer and biological male Dylan Mulvaney was featured in a cringeworthy and patronizing March Madness advertisement. Moreover, Americans suffering due to inflation under the Biden-Harris administration don’t appear to be influenced by celebrities and others in the entertainment industry with regards to politics or the upcoming presidential election — and are willing to put their money where their mouths are in order to make that known. As Breitbart News reported, pop star Taylor Swift’s popularity has dropped overall among voters following her endorsement of Harris this month. “Taylor Swift is a billionaire. She’s not at the grocery store having to decide whether to feed her family or pay her mortgage. While she’s flying her private jets, you’re struggling to gas up you car & get to work. It’s no surprise she’s ‘ok’ with 4 more years of this,” one social media user wrote in an X post, which garnered 121,000 likes. Alana Mastrangelo is a reporter for Breitbart News.

    "title": "WATCH: John Kerry Labels First Amendment ‘Major Block’ to Curbing ‘Disinformation’",
    "author": "Amy Furr",
    "content": "The Biden administration’s “climate envoy” John Kerry took heat recently for his comments about the First Amendment at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday. During a panel on Green Energy, an audience member asked the former secretary of state what can be done to combat so-called “disinformation” on the internet regarding “climate change,” Fox News reported on Sunday. “You know there’s a lot of discussion now about how you curb those entities in order to guarantee that you’re going to have some accountability on facts, etc.,” he said. “But look, if people go to only one source, and the source they go to is sick, and, you know, has an agenda, and they’re putting out disinformation, our First Amendment stands as a major block to the ability to be able to just, you know, hammer it out of existence,” Kerry added. “What we need is to win the ground, win the right to govern by hopefully winning enough votes that you’re free to be able to implement change,” he continued: Social media users were quick to offer comments on what Kerry said, one person writing, “Lurch doesn’t seem happy that his gatekeepers are no longer the only source of information these days.” “The first amendment is on the ballot folks,” another user said in reference to the upcoming presidential election between Vice President Kamala Harris (D) and former President Donald Trump (R). “What a Piece of garbage! This is exactly why we have the 1st Amendment!” someone else commented. The First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States reads, “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.” [Emphasis added.] According to a Breitbart News article from May 2023, Kerry is communist China’s “favorite American” and has refused to criticize the communist country’s expansion of coal burning and ongoing pollution. “Kerry himself occasionally admits that China keeps none of its climate promises and sees the issue as a far lower priority than winning its contest for economic and political influence with the United States,” the report said.",

    "title": "China After Strike on Hezbollah Mass Murderer Hassan Nasrallah: We Oppose Targeting ‘Innocent Civilians’",
    "author": "Frances Martel",
    "content": "The Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Sunday in response to the Shiite terrorist organization Hezbollah confirming the death of its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in which it declared that Beijing “opposes and condemns any action against innocent civilians.” The Foreign Ministry specified in the title of the statement that it was a direct response to “the killing of the leader of Lebanon’s Hezbollah Hassan Nasrallah,” not to any other military activity in the Middle East. Nasrallah, Hezbollah confirmed on Saturday, died on Friday after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched airstrikes targeting Hezbollah’s massive national headquarters in Beirut, Lebanon. Nasrallah had run the Iran-backed terrorist organization for over 30 years and was responsible for organizing and approving terrorist attacks responsible for an untold number of deaths, including the deaths of hundreds of Americans. Hezbollah has historically targeted American outposts in the Middle East and helped train terrorists who targeted Americans during the Iraq War. The IDF targeted the Hezbollah compound in Beirut, Lebanon, in response to Hezbollah’s ongoing attacks on northern Israel in support of Hamas, a Sunni jihadist terrorist organization also backed by Iran. The attacks had displaced an estimated 60,500 civilians in northern Israel and essentially made it impossible for Israel to govern that territory. The IDF airstrikes preceded a mysterious string of explosions in which hundreds of pagers, walkie-talkies, and other electronics spontaneously exploded, killing dozens, many of them high-ranking Hezbollah terrorists. Many of the electronics implicated, apparently planted with explosives, were owned by Hezbollah terrorists, indicating a targeted attack. Israel has not taken responsibility for the blasts at press time, however, nor has any other individual or entity. “China is closely following the incident and is deeply concerned over the escalation of tensions in the region,” the Foreign Ministry declared in response to Nasrallah’s death. “China opposes the infringement on Lebanon’s sovereignty and security, opposes and condemns any action against innocent civilians, and opposes any move that fuels antagonism and escalates regional tensions.” Beijing demanded that “parties concerned, especially Israel … immediately take actions to cool down” and that Israel end its war on Hamas in its territory of Gaza. The Chinese state propaganda outlet Global Times responded to the Nasrallah killing on Sunday by condemning the United States for its “indulgence” of Israel in publicly acknowledging Nasrallah’s status as a top-level terrorist and mass murderer. “Hassan Nasrallah and the terrorist group he led, Hezbollah, were responsible for killing hundreds of Americans over a four-decade reign of terror,” outgoing American President Joe Biden said in a statement following the confirmation of his death. “His death from an Israeli airstrike is a measure of justice for his many victims, including thousands of Americans, Israelis, and Lebanese civilians.” The Chinese newspaper condemned Biden’s statement and America’s longstanding alliance with Israel as “at odds with the mainstream sentiments of the international community,” citing its usual group of Communist Party-approved “experts.” “It is precisely the US’ indulgence that has led to the ongoing escalation of the situation in the Middle East today, analysts said,” the Times claimed. “The US plays a key role that allows, tolerates, or even instigates the escalation of this crisis, experts noted.” One “expert” said that the current conflict between Israel and Iran’s proxy terrorist arms was due to America’s “unreasonable and selfish” support for Israel. The Global Times notably omitted mention of the event that prompted the conflict: the October 7 massacre of 1,200 Israeli civilians, abduction of over 200 more, and widespread acts of gang rape, infanticide, and other atrocities committed by Hamas. China has not historically played a meaningful diplomatic role in the Middle East, instead forging ties through commerce. After October 7, however, the Communist Party has attempted to elevate its relevance in the region through support for Hamas, hosting summits intended to normalize relations between the terrorists of Hamas and hesitant Muslim partners. China has also expanded its relationship with Iran, facilitating Iran joining the anti-American BRICS coalition and vocally opposing sanctions on the rogue regime. Hezbollah is not known to have direct meaningful ties to Beijing, though Hassan Nasrallah on occasion expressed interest in having them. In 2006, evidence surfaced that Hezbollah used Chinese weapons in terrorist attacks, apparently obtained through Iran. Much more recently, in 2020, Nasrallah gave a speech in which he pressured Iran to allow China to expand its economic influence in the country. “Chinese companies are ready to bring in money, and without any of the complications that we talk about in Lebanon. We don’t have to give them money, they will bring money into the country,” Nasrallah claimed. Elsewhere in that speech, Nasrallah declared that his group would engage in terrorist violence to challenge the impact of sanctions on Hezbollah for its wanton human rights abuses: “Whoever is going to make us choose between being killed by weapons or being killed by starvation, I tell them: We will continue to carry our weapons and we won’t starve; and we will kill you.” Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.",

    "author": "Simon Kent",
    "content": "Former President Donald J. Trump took to social media Sunday and offered a prayer to Saint Michael the Archangel, adding his own spiritual perspective on the struggles – past, present, and future –  he continues to endure in the 2024 presidential race. Trump shared his public invocation on X during Michaelmas, offering: “Saint Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle. Be our defense against the wickedness and snares of the Devil.” “May God rebuke him, we humbly pray, and do thou, O Prince of the heavenly hosts, by the power of God, cast into hell Satan, and all the evil spirits, who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls. Amen.” Michaelmas, celebrated on September 29, is a Christian feast day honoring the Archangel Michael and all angels. It traditionally marks the end of the harvest season in Europe and serves as a reminder of spiritual strength and protection. September 29, for Catholics, is the wider feast of the archangels, especially Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael. File/Saint Michael the Archangel defeats Lucifer, 1656 Francesco Maffei 1605-1660.

    "content": "A 16-year-old alleged robber put a toy gun in a man’s back Sunday night in Philadelphia’s Kensington neighborhood only to have the man turn, pull a real gun, and shoot him. Two alleged robbers approached the man shortly after 11:00 p.m., NBC 10 noted. The 16-year-old allegedly pressed the toy gun into his back and demanded his valuables. The man appeared to be complying when he pulled a gun and shot the teenager in the leg. The alleged robber’s intended victim was legally armed. FOX 29 reported that he was a 21-year-old man who was walking with his girlfriend. Philadelphia Police Inspector DF Pace commented on the man shooting the teen who allegedly used a toy gun: “Having been pressed into the victim’s back, there would have been no way for them to know that.” The 16-year-old was taken into custody and transported to a hospital for treatment.

    "title": "WATCH — Netanyahu Reaches Out to Iranian People: ‘Israel Stands with You’",
    "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
    "content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu published a video Monday in which he addressed the people of Iran and expressed solidarity with them against their leaders. Netanyahu published the video as the Israeli military continued attacking Iran’s proxy, Hezbollah, in Lebanon, in an unexpected military rout that could leave Iran without a deterrent against an Israeli attack on its nuclear program. The Prime Minister’s Office published his speech, in full: I speak a lot about the leaders of Iran. Yet at this pivotal moment, I want to address you – the people of Iran. I want to do so directly, without filters, without middlemen. Every day, you see a regime that subjugates you, makes fiery speeches about defending Lebanon, defending Gaza. Yet every day, that regime plunges our region deeper into darkness and deeper into war. Every day, their puppets are eliminated. Ask Mohammed Deif. Ask Nasrallah. There is nowhere in the Middle East Israel cannot reach. There is nowhere we will not go to protect our people and protect our country. With every passing moment, the regime is bringing you — the noble Persian people — closer to the abyss. The vast majority of Iranians know their regime doesn’t care a whit about them. If it did care, if it cared about you, it would stop wasting billions of dollars on futile wars across the Middle East. It would start improving your lives. Imagine if all the vast money the regime wasted on nuclear weapons and foreign wars were invested in your children’s education, in improving your health care, in building your nation’s infrastructure, water, sewage, all the other things that you need. Imagine that. But you know one simple thing – Iran’s tyrants don’t care about your future. But you do. When Iran is finally free and that moment will come a lot sooner than people think – everything will be different. Our two ancient peoples, the Jewish people and the Persian people, will finally be at peace. Our two countries, Israel and Iran, will be at peace. When that day comes, the terror network that the regime built in five continents will be bankrupt, dismantled. Iran will thrive as never before. Global investment. Massive tourism. Brilliant technological innovation based on the tremendous talents that exist inside Iran. Doesn’t that sound better than endless poverty, repression and war? From Qom to Esfahan, from Shiraz to Tabriz, there are tens of millions of good and decent people with thousands of years of history behind them and a brilliant future ahead of them. Don’t let a small group of fanatic theocrats crush your hopes and your dreams. You deserve better. Your children deserve better. The entire world deserves better. I know you don’t support the rapists and murderers of Hamas and Hezbollah, but your leaders do. You deserve more. The people of Iran should know – Israel stands with you. May we together know a future of prosperity and peace. Netanyahu has addressed the Iranian people directly on at least one occasion, when he offered them Israeli water technology in 2018 amid shortages caused by the regime’s poor planning. Last week, Netanyahu published a speech addressed directly to the people of Lebanon, telling them: “Israel’s war is not with you. It’s with Hezbollah.” Breitbart News asked the Israeli government Monday in a press briefing whether Israel was considering an attack on Iran’s nuclear program. The noncommittal answer was that Israel is capable of reaching any place in Iran and that the Israeli military is prepared both for defensive and offensive operations. A successful attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities could destabilize the regime and offer an opportunity for internal opponents of Iran’s theocracy to overthrow it. Joel B.

    "author": "Wendell Husebo",
    "content": "The New York Times endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris on Monday for president, claiming she is the “only patriotic choice.” The Times endorsement of Harris is not surprising. The media, and especially the Times, appear to be working overtime to get her elected. The Times’s Editorial Board gushed: Most presidential elections are, at their core, about two different visions of America that emerge from competing policies and principles. This one is about something more foundational. It is about whether we invite into the highest office in the land a man who has revealed, unmistakably, that he will degrade the values, defy the norms and dismantle the institutions that have made our country strong. As a dedicated public servant who has demonstrated care, competence and an unwavering commitment to the Constitution, Ms. Harris stands alone in this race. She may not be the perfect candidate for every voter, especially those who are frustrated and angry about our government’s failures to fix what’s broken — from our immigration system to public schools to housing costs to gun violence. Yet we urge Americans to contrast Ms. Harris’s record with her opponent’s. Ms. Harris is more than a necessary alternative. There is also an optimistic case for elevating her, one that is rooted in her policies and borne out by her experience as vice president, a senator and a state attorney general. Media elites changed their breadth of coverage of Harris as soon as she entered the race, taking a 180 degree turn that some Republicans predicted would happen at the time. “Harris is being transformed from a national punch line into a rock star,” National Review‘s Noah Rothman reported in August. “[T]he determination displayed by journalists to polish Harris’s apple are working in Democrats’ favor.” Harris held the lowest net negative rating (-17) for a vice president in U.S. history before she joined the race. Her approval rating was only 28 percent in January 2024, and it only improved to 32 percent in July, the month President Joe Biden stepped aside. Harris’s approval rating is now approximately 48 percent, an increase of 16 points in just two months. Television networks have provided Harris with 84 percent “positive coverage,” a Media Research Center study found in August, while they produced 89 percent negative coverage of former President Donald Trump.

    "title": "Iran’s ‘Moderate’ President Vows to Avenge Hezbollah Mass Murderer Nasrallah",
    "author": "Frances Martel",
    "content": "Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, elected in a special election this year after campaigning as a “moderate” candidate, menacingly declared weekend his regime would give Israel a “decisive” response to its elimination of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah. Killing Nasrallah, the head of a genocidal terrorist organization responsible for the displacement of tens of thousands in northern Israel in the past year, was “unacceptable,” Pezeshkian said on Sunday, according to the Iranian propaganda outlet PressTV, and Tehran would help Hezbollah, as well as promote the “importance of supporting the Hezbollah fighters.” Pezeshkian joined a chorus of Iranian voices, including “supreme leader” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, promising to avenge the removal of Nasrallah from the battlefield. The Iranian Foreign Ministry on Monday promised reporters that radical Islamists would soon “celebrate the death of Zionism” despite the loss of one of international jihad’s most prominent figures, and that Iran would support global efforts to destroy Israel. Pezeshkian reportedly condemned Nasrallah’s killing on onday in conversations with several new ambassadors to Tehran, including those of Germany, Denmark, Norway, Qatar, and Niger. “If the Islamic governments had had unity and solidarity and had acted and protested against the Zionist regime’s [Israel’s] crimes with a united voice, we would have not witnessed the commitment and rude continuation of the criminal measures of the (Israeli) regime,” Pezeshkian reportedly complained, suggesting Muslim countries are not doing enough to support anti-Israel terrorism. A day prior, Pezeshkian declared that Iran must give a “decisive” response to Nasrallah’s death. “Addressing a cabinet session on Sunday, Pezeshkian once again strongly condemned Israel’s assassination of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the longtime leader of the Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah,” PressTV reported, “in a massive airstrike on southern Beirut on Friday using American-supplied bunker-buster bombs.” “This crime once again proved that this criminal regime does not adhere to any of the international principles and rules,” Pezeshkian was quoted as saying, calling the removal of a mass murderer from the battlefield “unacceptable” and promising it would “not go unanswered.” “Pezeshkian stressed the importance of supporting the Hezbollah fighters in their war with Israel,” PressTV added, “to prevent the atrocious regime from attacking countries of the axis of resistance and killing innocent women and children.” Nasrallah died following a targeted airstrike by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Hezbollah’s compound in Beirut on Friday. The IDF reportedly eliminated a large number of Hezbollah leaders in the attack, a response to Hezbollah’s incessant terrorist attacks this year in support of fellow Iran-backed terrorist outfit Hamas. Hamas conducted an unprecedented siege of Israel on October 7, 2023, that resulted in 1,200 deaths and dozens of abductions. About 100 Israeli hostages remain in Hamas captivity at press time. Nasrallah became the leader of Hezbollah, a Shiite genocidal jihadist organization based in Lebanon, in 1992. Hezbollah has for decades received support and guidance from the Iranian Islamist regime and has, in turn, conducted violent terrorist acts on behalf Iran. Hezbollah is particularly responsible for at least hundreds of American deaths in terrorist attacks on American targets such as embassies and military outposts. “During the Iraq War, according to a U.S. congressional research report, Hezbollah members armed and trained Shia militias that carried out attacks on U.S. forces during their deployments between 2003 and 2011,” NPR noted in its coverage of Nasrallah’s death. “Hassan Nasrallah and the terrorist group he led, Hezbollah, were responsible for killing hundreds of Americans over a four-decade reign of terror,” outgoing American President Joe Biden said in a statement. “His death from an Israeli airstrike is a measure of justice for his many victims, including thousands of Americans, Israelis, and Lebanese civilians.” Outside of targeting Israel and the United States, Argentine investigators found Hezbollah and Iran jointly responsible for 1992 and 1994 bombings in the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires and the Argentine-Israeli Mutual Association (AMIA), respectively. The latter bombing killed 85 people and was the deadliest terrorist attack in the history of the Western Hemisphere prior to September 11, 2001. An Argentine court declared Hezbollah guilty in April of executing the attacks, adding that it did so at the Iranian government’s bidding. Pezeshkian’s vocal support of one of the Middle East’s deadliest terror leaders contradicts the public image the Iranian president has attempted to build in the West as a “moderate” seeking to limit the power of radical Islamist elements of his government over his people. Pezeshkian campaigned as a political mildly critical of Iran’s “morality police” focused on fighting inflation and solving the problems Iranians face in their daily lives, de-emphasizing Iran’s role as the world’s premier state sponsor of terrorism. Pezeshkian has also flirted with the possibility of returning to nuclear negotiations with the United States after former President Donald Trump withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal in 2018. Pezeshkian has not acted to affirm the modest optimism that some political observers had that is presidency would take a more conciliatory approach to supporting jihadist terror. His comments on Nasrallah align with the kind words Khamenei offered on Saturday following the confirmation of Nasrallah’s death, in which he also predicted that jihadists would become more violent against Israel in response. Khamenei declared a five-day mourning period for Nasrallah. “The blessing of martyrdom was his undeniable right after all these efforts,” Khamenei reportedly said. “The Leader, however emphasized, the blessings of decades of Nasrallah’s prudence and jihad will never be lost,” the Iranian Tasnim News Agency added. Similarly, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kan’ani celebrated Nasrallah on Monday and warned Tehran was interested in helping seek revenge on Israel. “Iran will continue its political and legal efforts and will carry out its proportionate and decisive measures,” to avenge Nasrallah, he said. “We have no doubt that the resistance front and the Lebanese nation will celebrate the death of Zionism and liberation of holy al-Quds [Jerusalem] in the near future,” he reportedly added.

    "title": "Israel Kills Hamas Commander in Lebanon; Terrorist Worked for UNRWA",
    "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
    "content": "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Israel Security Agency (ISA) announced Monday that they had killed Fateh Sherif, who led Hamas in Lebanon. He was also a United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) employee. In a joint statement, the IDF and ISA said: Overnight, during a joint IDF and ISA intelligence-based activity, the IAF struck and eliminated the terrorist Fateh Sherif, Head of the Lebanon Branch in the Hamas terrorist organization. Sherif was responsible for coordinating Hamas’ terror activities in Lebanon with Hezbollah operatives. He was also responsible for Hamas’ efforts in Lebanon to recruit operatives and acquire weapons. He led the Hamas terrorist organization’s force build-up efforts in Lebanon and operated to advance Hamas’ interests in Lebanon, both politically and militarily. The IDF and the ISA will to continue to operate against anyone who poses a threat to the civilians of the State of Israel. UNRWA acknowledged that Fateh Sherif had been the principal of one of its schools, the Times of Israel reported: Sherif was killed today in an airstrike on the al-Bass refugee camp in the southern Lebanese city of Tyre, along with his wife and children. Reports indicate he had been the principal of the UNRWA-run Deir Yassin Secondary School in al-Bass. “Fateh Al Sharif was an UNRWA employee who was put on administrative leave without pay in March, and was undergoing an investigation following allegations that UNRWA received about his political activities,” UNRWA says in response to a Times of Israel query. Sherif’s suspension for three months had sparked protests in Lebanon, the Times of Israel added. Israeli government spokesman David Mencer told reporters on Monday that Sherif had been head of the UNRWA teachers’ association in Lebanon. He said that UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini  had to answer: “What on earth is a terrorist doing as one of your teachers?” Several UNRWA employees were also found to have participated in the October 7 terror attacks. Israel has called for the dismantling of the agency. Then-President Donald Trump cut off its U.S. funding in 2018, but President Joe Biden restored it upon taking office. The Biden administration suspended funding to UNRWA after evidence of its ties to terror emerged after October 7. Several Democratic members of Congress, backed by far-left J Street, have proposed a bill to restore funding to UNRWA; they acknowledge its role in terror but insist it can be reformed and trusted with U.S. taxpayers’ money. Mencer said that UNRWA could not be reformed, and recounted the agency’s collaboration with Hamas in Gaza and elsewhere. “UNRWA, unfortunately, is a front for Hamas.” Sherif was the latest major terrorist leader to be killed in two weeks of Israeli attacks on Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel also killed three senior members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), another terrorist group. In a statement, the IDF and ISA said they had killed Nidal Abdel-Aal, head of the PFLP’s Lebanon branch, as well as Imad Odeh, the head of the PFLP’s military office in Lebanon. They added that Abdel-Aal had directed terror attacks on Israelis in Judea and Samaria (the West Bank), including a bus bombing and a shooting attack, both in 2023. Joel B.

    "author": "Thomas D. Williams, Ph.D.",
    "content": "Poorer populations are “woefully unprepared” for the climate crisis, asserts a new report from the International Labor Organization (ILO). According to Gilbert F. Houngbo, ILO Director-General, the climate change crisis “represents the single gravest threat to social justice today,” an astounding assertion given the number of real threats to social justice, such as multiple bloody wars, famines, widespread human trafficking, and dozens of authoritarian regimes that trample the rights of citizens — including that of Mr. Houngbo’s native country of Togo, where he was prime minister from 2008 to 2012. In its most recent annual Democracy Index, the Economist Intelligence Unit noted that 40 percent of the world’s population lives under authoritarian rule, including the citizens of Togo, which earned a composite score of just 2.99 on the Index out of a possible 10, with a score of 2.94 in the important category of “civil liberties.” The ILO report declares that in the 20 countries most vulnerable to the climate crisis (16 of which are in Africa), 91.3 percent of the population (364 million people) lack any form of social protection. RELATED: Elderly Climate Activists Attempt to Damage Magna Carta The report laments that while high-income countries spend on average 16.2 percent of their gross domestic product (GDP) on social protection, low-income countries, “including those most vulnerable to climate change,” spend only 0.8 percent. The findings of the ILO report were enthusiastically trumpeted by the UK-based Lancet medical journal, which has made a name for itself with its ideologically driven, unscientific climate change alarmism. Late last year, the once venerable Lancet declared that global warming is the biggest global health threat of the 21st century, an assertion that fails to stand up to even the most casual scrutiny. The Lancet made the astonishing claim that climate change has been “confirmed” as the century’s number one health threat, a remarkable feat since the century is not even a quarter over. According to the journal, climate change promises greater harm to health than heart disease, cancer, war, malaria, respiratory maladies, and biological warfare, despite the fact that no one has ever died of climate change. Although the Lancet spoke of the “findings” of its 2023 report, what it really offered were predictions, forecasts, and prophecies, since the next 70+ decades are still in the future and cannot be examined as yet.

    "title": "Helene Death Toll Closes on 100 as Supplies, Aid Rushed to Still-Isolated Areas",
    "author": "Simon Kent",
    "content": "Fresh water, fuel, food, medical, and other essential supplies were being rushed to flood-stricken areas Monday after Hurricane Helene left a trail of destruction across the U.S. southeast. At least 91 people across several states were killed after the behemoth weather event reached full force over the weekend. A North Carolina county that includes the mountain city of Asheville reported 30 people killed, AP reports. Gov. Roy Cooper predicted the toll would rise as rescuers and other emergency workers reached areas isolated by collapsed roads, failing infrastructure and widespread flooding. Supplies were being airlifted to the region around the isolated city of Asheville, the AP report continued. Monster! Hurricane Helene Seen from Space Buncombe County Manager Avril Pinder pledged she would have food and water to the city by Monday. “We hear you. We need food and we need water,” Pinder said on a Sunday call with reporters. “My staff has been making every request possible to the state for support and we’ve been working with every single organization that has reached out. What I promise you is that we are very close.” President Joe Biden described the impact of the storm as “stunning” and said he would visit the area this week at a time still to be determined. As Biden waits to choose a time to visit, former President Donald Trump will visit the city of Valdosta, Georgia, which was left devastated in the storm. In a press release issued on Sunday, the Trump campaign announced he would be visiting Valdosta “to receive a briefing on the devastation” from the hurricane and to “facilitate the distribution of relief supplies.” As Breitbart News reported, Helene, downgraded from a strong Category 4 storm, made landfall in Florida’s Big Bend region Thursday evening. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) is warning of “catastrophic and life-threatening” flash flooding inland as still a possibility.",

    "title": "Nigel Farage Declares Conservative Party Brand is ‘Completely Broken’",
    "author": "Kurt Zindulka",
    "content": "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage pronounced that the Tory brand is “completely broken” as the so-called Conservative Party leadership contest goes into full swing this week. The interminable 14-week Conservative Party leadership race to replace failed PM Rishi Sunak will see the final four contenders head to Birmingham as the party holds its annual conference. The contest, which has failed to generate much interest among the public, will see anti-woke former equalities minister Kemi Badenoch, arch-centrist ex-Home Secretary James Cleverly, faux-hardliner former immigration minister Robert Jenrick, and neo-con MP Tom Tugendhat make their main pitches to party members, who will whittle down the field to two candidates this week before a final decision is made in November. Still reeling from the electoral debacle, which saw the main British establishment political party lose a staggering 251 seats and cede power to the feckless Labour Party, the Conservatives remain without a cohesive vision for the future, with the party being split between neo-liberal “One Nation” Tories like Tugendhat, establishment figures like Cleverly, and Badenoch and Jenrick battling for control of the supposed right of the party. Commenting on the leadership race, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage remarked: “The Conservative Party is split down the middle and the brand is completely broken.” The Brexit boss, who is seeking to leapfrog the Tories and lead his party to defeat Labour in the next election, kept his focus to the two candidates seemingly fighting for the conservative wing of the party, Badenoch and Jenrick. “Kemi Badenoch has spent weeks positioning herself as tough on immigration.But in 2018 she campaigned in Parliament to increase legal migration, and was the biggest champion for students bringing in dependents. I don’t believe a word that she says on anything,” Farage declared. Turning his ire on the former immigration minister, Farage accused Jenrick of being a man who “believed in nothing” but now attempts to cast himself as “the great hardliner”. “This is almost certainly done for political gain and not out of conviction. He will divide the party,” the Reform leader predicted. “I doubt that Jenrick will last long if he wins.” Recently-installed Reform UK chairman Zia Yusuf echoed a similar sentiment over the weekend, telling GB News that the Conservative Party is on its way to being “consigned to the history books”. “The Tories are done, the British people now see the Tory party for what they are, which is a party that will say absolutely anything to get themselves elected and then do the complete opposite when they come into power.” “People at home listening to these Tory leadership hopefuls must be shaking their heads in disbelief at how shameless it is. They promised in manifesto after manifesto to bring net migration down to the tens of thousands [but] left office having exploded the size of the population with that number at three quarters of a million.” Yusuf also noted that the previous government presided over the imposition of the highest tax burden since the Second World War, allowed knife crime to run rampant, and permitted “wokery” to spread throughout major British institutions, particularly in the civil service. Responding to attempts by the candidates to distance themselves from their own party’s history, the Reform chairman quipped: “I’m amazed, frankly, that they’re able to say these things with a straight face.”",

    "title": "Deindustrialisation Speedrun: Britain’s Final Coal Power Plant, Steel Blast Furnace Close Today",
    "author": "Oliver JJ Lane",
    "content": "Britain’s final coal-fired power station and its penultimate steel plant shut their doors today, a consequence of the government’s hard push for decarbonisation, even at the cost of affordable energy or an indigenous steel making capacity, crucial for the defence industry. They’re hundreds of miles away from each other but two of the final bastions of the British industrial revolution shut forever today, their respective demises very linked through the slow-burning but very much ongoing British electricity price crisis. Ratcliffe on Soar, once the cutting-edge in coal-fired steam turbine electricity production and the blast furnace at Port Talbot both close on Monday, coincidentally just days after fresh figures show Britain has the most expensive electricity prices in the world by a considerable margin. Ratcliffe-on-Soar, a familiar sight to the people of the East Midlands where its cooling towers commanded the flat landscape for miles around was originally meant to have shut down in 2022 but was granted a stay of execution after Russia invaded Ukraine, sending the global energy market into crisis as the supply of gas to Europe suddenly became unpredictable and fraught with political difficulties. Britain had been the first country in the world to build a coal-fired power plant 142 years ago and today is the first major economy to close all of its coal power plants, although smaller states like Portugal and Sweden got there first. The power station is now to be pulled down and the land redeveloped, removing any chance of reactivating the plant should a sudden change in the global energy picture again impact supply. The route to today’s closure stretches back decades, from the Margaret Thatcher administration’s clashes with the powerful coal unions which attempted to shut the country down with strikes which precipitated a dash for gas in the 1990s. Coal has serious advantages over other sources of energy, not least among them it is cheap, available in large quantities domestically, reducing Britain’s reliance on unreliable foreign partners, and it can easily be stockpiled ready for use. On the other hand it is the bête noire of environmentalists, and has been aggressively targeted by the British government in its push to decarbonise. Nominally Conservative former finance minister George Osborne introduced a ‘carbon price’ in 2013, making generating electricity with coal artificially more expensive through taxes to force generators to other sources. By 2015, the government was announcing it would force the phase-out of all coal power generation within a decade, that target being met today. As one report in 2020 found, UK carbon taxes killed 93 per cent of coal-fired energy generation. University College London said: British electricity generated from coal fell from 13.1 TWh (terawatt hours) in 2013 to 0.97 TWh in September 2019, and was replaced by other less emission-heavy forms of generation such as gas… Increased electricity imports from the continent reduced the price impact in the UK. The problem is electricity is now extremely expensive in the United Kingdom. Indeed, it is now the most expensive in the world, thanks in large part to government intervention forcing a green push without addressing the nation’s underlying problems with energy storage. The latest figures reveal price of electricity has increased 124 per cent in the past five years — as the final coal plants tailed off, although other factors were also at play — and power in Britain is half as expensive again as it is in Europe. Contrasting to the United States, which embraced fracking to become a major producer of power in its own right, electricity in the United Kingdom is four times more expensive, it has been reported. High energy costs are seriously damaging to the competitiveness to energy intense industries and discourage investment. The apex example of heavy industry fleeing expensive energy is the production of steel, which is now probably in its final months in the United Kingdom. In a remarkable sort of coincidence, the closure of the Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station comes the same day as the closure of the final steelmaking blast furnace at Port Talbot, south Wales. This closure has attracted months of interest given the very high number of job losses expected in a Labour-voting area. But nevertheless the government declined to prevent the closure and in a way subsidised its demolition, with a half-billion sterling pay-out to help build a new electric arc furnaces in the town to replace the blast furnace. The problem is of course, even in an intensely energy-demanding industry like steel production, electric arc furnaces use even more electricity, and can’t actually produce new steel, they are merely used to recycle old. The only other location in the United Kingdom left that can produce virgin steel is Chinese-owned Scunthorpe in Lincolnshire, and that could very well close this year too, potentially creating another national security question. As the GMB Union said earlier this year: “Fresh steel is vital for warships and other parts of the defence industry”. Their spokesman said of the issue that both the UK government and NATO had warned war was around the corner and yet the state was allowing domestic steel production to slip through its fingers. He said: “We are on the brink of losing our full ability to make our own steel, vital to our defence industry – not least in building warships. It’s utter folly.” The fact is that British steel is very expensive to produce, and energy prices are a contributing factor to that. Where prices are lower, for instance in China, the communist state is able to continue to depress the global market by dumping vast quantities of coal-made cheap steel. UK Steel complained in July its plants were paying double for electricity what was paid in France and Spain at £113 per megawatt including wholesale electricity costs, grid connection charges, and carbon taxes. Recent figures for Chinese energy costs show they are a fraction of what is paid by European businesses, and China still relies on coal in a way the West no longer does. The United Kingdom still imports steel, having effectively offshored its emissions — for steel still produces carbon wherever it is made — and its jobs, too. The United Kingdom now faces the coming winter without the capacity to fire up a reserve coal fired power plant to even out market price fluctuations, or even to simply keep the lights on in a crisis. Just last Spring a bout of cloudy, cold weather with no wind saw coal brought back to make up for lost renewables.",

    "author": "Simon Kent",
    "content": "Former President Jimmy Carter received fond birthday wishes Sunday from President Joe Biden, with the soon-to-depart White House octogenarian telling him, “Mr. President, I admire you so darn much.” “Your hopeful vision of our country, your commitment to a better world, and your unwavering belief in the power of human goodness continues to be a guiding light for all of us,” Biden said in a birthday message released to CBS News. The current president cited Carter, who was president of the United States from 1977 to 1981, as “one of the most influential statesmen in our history,” for his work both in high office and the years since. “Even after you left office, the moral clarity you showed throughout your career showed through again in your commitment through the Carter Center and Habitat for Humanity — resolving conflicts, advancing democracy, preventing disease, and so much more. It’s transforming the lives of people not only at home but around the world,” Biden said. File/In this April 30, 2021, photo released by The White House, former President Jimmy Carter and former first lady Rosalynn Carter pose for a photo with President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden at the home of the Carter’s in Plains Ga. (Adam Schultz, The White House) Biden noted his 1976 endorsement of Carter’s presidential campaign — the first nod of support Carter received from an elected official outside of his home state of Georgia. “Mr. President, you’ve always been a moral force for our nation and the world. I recognized that as a young senator. That’s why I supported you so early. You’re a voice of courage, conviction, compassion, and most of all, a beloved friend of Jill and me and our family,” he said. Carter’s 100th birthday Tuesday is the first without his longtime wife, former first lady Rosalynn Carter, who died in November 2023 at the age of 96. RELATED: GOP Sen. Braun — Biden’s Budget Is Like Jimmy Carter’s Policies, Will Cause Stagflation “We know this is the first birthday without Rosalynn. It’s bittersweet, but we also know she’s always with you. She’s in your heart; she’ll never go away. She may be gone, but she’s always going to be with you. She’s always there, and I know you know that,” Biden said in his message. As Breitbart News reported, Biden revealed last year he has been personally chosen by Carter to deliver his memorial service eulogy when he dies. “I spent time with Jimmy Carter, and it’s finally caught up with him, but they found a way to keep him going for a lot longer than they anticipated because they found a breakthrough,” Biden told guests at a Democratic National Committee fundraiser.

    "author": "Lucas Nolan",
    "content": "Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and Threads, is blocking links to a dossier allegedly containing sensitive information about Sen. JD Vance (R-OH), which was obtained through an Iranian hack of the Trump campaign. The Verge reports that in a move to enforce its policies against sharing content from hacked sources and foreign government interference in U.S. elections, Meta has begun restricting links to a newsletter containing an alleged dossier on Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump’s vice presidential running mate. The document, which was obtained through an Iranian hack of the Trump campaign, has been circulating on various social media platforms. According to Meta spokesperson Dave Arnold, the company’s policies “do not allow content from hacked sources or content leaked as part of a foreign government operation to influence US elections.” As a result, Meta has taken steps to block the sharing of such materials on its apps, including Facebook, Instagram, and the recently launched Threads. Users on Threads have reported that their posts containing links to the dossier have been removed by Meta. The company also appears to be disabling links to the document hosted on other platforms, such as Scribd and Google Drive. However, Meta does not seem to be blocking posts about the dossier or searches related to it. The alleged JD Vance dossier was published in a newsletter by journalist Ken Klippenstein. In response to Meta’s actions, users have resorted to sharing links to Google searches for Klippenstein’s Substack article or posting the direct link with random spaces, words in place of punctuation, or even QR codes to circumvent the restrictions. Meta is not alone in its efforts to limit the spread of the document. X, formerly known as Twitter, has also been blocking links to the story. Some users have reported being unable to share the document via their Google Drive accounts, although this appears to be inconsistent, as some users have successfully shared it between personal accounts.

    "title": "The Defense Rests: Google Antitrust Trial Prepares for Closing Arguments",
    "author": "Lucas Nolan",
    "content": "The DOJ and Google have wrapped up their arguments in the high-stakes antitrust trial against the internet giant, with closing arguments scheduled for November. MarketingBrew reports that the courtroom battle between Google and the DOJ over allegations of monopolistic practices designed to crush competitors in the ad-tech sector has reached a critical juncture. After three weeks of testimony from both sides, the trial has adjourned until closing arguments are presented in November, leaving the industry eagerly awaiting a ruling that could have far-reaching implications for the digital advertising landscape. Throughout the trial, the DOJ focused on arguing that Google has leveraged its dominant position in the ad-tech market to maintain a “trifecta of monopolies.” The government’s legal team presented evidence and expert testimony to support their claims that Google has monopolized ad servers, ad exchanges, and tied its ad-tech businesses together through exclusive deals. According to evidence introduced by the DOJ, Google’s publisher ad server commands a staggering 91 percent global market share. Witnesses from ad-tech companies and publishers testified about the challenges they faced in competing with Google and the near-impossibility of avoiding the company’s ad server. The DOJ also argued that Google’s ad exchange, AdX, holds the largest market share in the industry and charges among the highest take rates, making it largely unavoidable for publishers seeking access to Google’s vast pool of advertisers. Central to the DOJ’s argument was the assertion that Google has tied its ad-tech businesses together through exclusive deals. The government’s legal team presented evidence showing that publishers can only access real-time bidding data if they use Google’s ad server and can only access Google’s advertisers if they use Google’s ad exchange. This exclusivity, the DOJ argued, has allowed Google to maintain its dominance across multiple segments of the ad-tech ecosystem. In response, Google’s lawyers attempted to rebut these claims by arguing that the ad market is competitive and unveiling a complex diagram of ad-tech companies and functions to demonstrate the interconnectedness of the ecosystem. They also positioned Google as a willing partner, highlighting recent deals with companies like X and its failed bid for Netflix’s advertising business. Breitbart News will continue to report on developments in the case leading up to closing arguments. Read more at MarketingBrew here.

    "title": "Poll: Donald Trump Leads Pennsylvania by Just over 2 Points",
    "author": "Paul Bois",
    "content": "Former President Donald Trump leads Kamala Harris in the swing state of Pennsylvania by just over two points, a poll shows. Surveying 1,090 registered voters in the state between September 26-29 with a margin of error +/- 2.9 percent, the Trafalgar Group poll showed Trump leading Harris in Pennsylvania 47.5 percent to 45.3 percent. Given the margin of error, that puts the two in a virtual tie, rending Pennsylvania a tossup state. Conversely, in the Pennsylvania U.S. Senate race, Democrat Bob Casey leads his Republican challenger Dave McCormick 47.4 percent to 45.6 percent within the margin of error. Pennsylvania remains one of the toughest battleground states for the former president, along with Michigan and Georgia. It also proven to be an elusive state when understanding the state’s attitudes toward the given candidates. According to a recent Spotlight PA/MassINC poll last week, Harris leads by five-points in the crucial swing. Per the Hill: Harris is winning 49 percent support in the poll, compared to 44 percent for Trump, in the race for the Keystone State’s 19 electoral votes. The polling results were within the margin of error at 4.0 percentage points with a 95 percent level of confidence, including the design effect. Polling averages from The Hill/Decision Desk HQ show Harris with a 1.2 percentage point advantage in the state. Harris wins 49.1 percent support in the polling averages, compared to 47.9 percent for Trump. As Breitbart News reported last week, a recent New York Times poll put the former president ahead of Harris in the the sun belt states of Georgia, North Carolina, and Arizona. In Michigan, Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), the U.S. Democrat senate nominee, warned last week that Vice President Kamala Harris may be “underwater” in her race against former President Donald Trump. Speaking with donors at a fundraiser last Wednesday attended by Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), Slotkin said she is “not feeling my best right now about where we are on Kamala Harris in a place like Michigan,” a swing state that Trump won in 2016 before losing to Joe Biden in 2020. RELATED: “USA!” Crowd at Alabama-Georgia Goes Wild for Trump Tossing Chicken Tenders “We have her underwater in our polling,” Slotkin said in a video clip obtained by Axios. Slotkin did not provide exact polling numbers and gave no comment when pressed by Axios. The latest polls out of Michigan show that the race has been tightening between the two candidates, with Harris either holding a slim lead or Trump locked in a virtual tie. The FiveThirtyEight average of polls put Harris up by just two points in the state while a New York Times/Siena College poll put her up by one. Since both polls stand within the margin of error, the race could be best described as a virtual tie.",

    "title": "Watch — ‘Shazam!’ Star Zachary Levi: It Was Worth It to Endorse Trump, Even if It Means ‘Career Suicide’",
    "author": "Paul Bois",
    "content": "Actor Zachary Levi, star of Hollywood franchises Chuck and Shazam!, opened his endorsement of former President Donald Trump in the 2024 election this weekend, in the all-important battleground state of Michigan, with a message of unity, saying all Americans, regardless of political party, “deserve to be seen and loved and valued.” Levi walked onto the stage to introduce a panel discussion between former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and began with a call for people of all stripes to express love and appreciation for their fellow American. “Turn to the person next to you and say, ‘hey, I’m really glad that you’re alive and I’m really glad that you’re here right now,” he told the crowd. After the crowd happily complied, Levi followed it up with a Christian message of unity. “That’s called love and that’s called unity,” he said. “We’re here for unity. We’re here to make sure that we value every single person. Every single person. Whether you’re a Democrat. Whether you’re a Republican. Whether you’re a Libertarian. An Independent. Every single one of us is a child of God. Every single one of us is deserving of being seen and heard and loved and valued.” The crowd cheered on his message. Levi said that he based his endorsement of Trump on Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s endorsement of the former president. He described his family as Christian conservatives who were Kennedy Democrats before flipping to Reagan Republicans. “My parents were Kennedy Democrats that then turned into Reagan Republicans,” Levi said. “And they taught me to have a healthy level of distrust for the government and a healthy level of distrust for industry that runs amok.” “We live in a country that’s been hijacked by a lot of people who want to take this place off the cliff,” he added. “We’re here to stop that. We’re here to make sure we are going to take back this country.” During the panel discussion with Gabbard and Kennedy Jr., Levi said that he appreciated how the Trump administration had no new wars. “Under President Trump, we had no new wars,” exclaimed Levi. “And now under this administration, we are in countless, we are in more and more.” Levi also later expressed concern about the Deep State and large companies like Black Rock influencing American foreign policies. When the panel closed, Levi expressed gratitude to Americans for their reasoned response to his endorsing former President Donald Trump. “When I said I was endorsing President Trump through my endorsement of Tulsi and Bobby, the messages that I’ve received … my followers on social media, 90 percent have been quite lovely and supportive and I’ve really appreciated that,” he said. “Including some people that don’t agree with me, don’t agree with President Trump, but they at least are civil enough to recognize that these are conversations that we should have and not just shouting matches and not just hating on people.” Levi didn’t let the event end without address how his endorsement of President Trump could amount to “career suicide.” “When I came out and I said I was endorsing President Trump through my endorsement of Tulsi and Bobbi. … Within my industry, as you can probably imagine, Hollywood is a very, very liberal town and this very well could constitute career suicide, so I’m glad I did it with you guys,” he said.",

    "title": "Feds Admit 155,000 Migrant Driver Arrests as Auto Insurance Spikes",
    "author": "Neil Munro",
    "content": "The federal government has released data showing more than 155,000 migrants have been convicted — or face charges — for criminal traffic offenses as Americans’ auto insurance bills rise rapidly. The huge imported population of dangerous, drunk, drugged, or reckless drivers was revealed in a report by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency within the Department of Homeland Security. For example, the data shows that 77,074 undetained migrants have been convicted of criminal traffic offenses, and an additional 46,269 migrants face criminal traffic charges. These migrants are not detained by ICE, but some may be detained by other government agencies. Many of the drivers crossed the border years before President Joe Biden’s economic deputies pulled in roughly 10 million illegal, illegal, temporary, and quasi-legal migrants. The data also shows that 2,663 migrants have been convicted of stealing a vehicle, but are not detained by ICE. An additional 1,593 migrants face theft charges and are also not detained. The data does not show how many Americans have been killed or injured by migrant drivers. The data was provided to Rep. Tony Gonzales (R-TX) on September 25 by Patrick Lechleitner, the acting chief of ICE. Cities “‘Sanctuary’ policies can end up shielding dangerous criminals, who often victims these same communities,” Lechleitner wrote. Auto insurance rates climb as more drivers crash their cars and as more autos are stolen. The connection between the White House’s migration policy and Americans’ monthly insurance rates is spotlighted in Springfield, OH., where insurance bills are rising by roughly 30 percent because the 20,000 imported Haitian migrants are crashing and damaging their cars at very high rates. In a September 8 TikTok video, Springfield resident, Dustin Geisel said the inflow of Haitians raised his auto-insurance rates: I live in Springfield, Ohio, where the influx of Haitians are and we had a enormous amount of car accidents because they don’t know how to drive. So now, because that, my car insurance has gone up significantly. I might as well be taking out another car payment at this point just to cover my cars, but the government makes it so that you have to have car insurance. So I thought, you know, I’m going to shop around and see if I can find a cheaper rate. And all of the other insurance companies have given me the same rate, if not more, so I don’t have a chance. The rising accidents and insurance rates are such a problem that even Ohio’s pro-migration GOP governor, Mike DeWine, has taken notice. “My wife Fran and I have been in Haiti several times and driving [there is] just very, very different,”  DeWine told ABC.  He added: Again, Haiti is not [sic] a country [where] many people don’t drive at all. There aren’t that many cars per capita. And people who do drive in Haiti are very, very different than they are in the United States … So the challenge is to get driver training for these individuals so that when they do go on the road, you know they will be safe. We have a law in Ohio that says that once you turn 18, or if you’re over 18, you can get a driver’s license in the state — you have to pass a test, but you don’t have to have any driver’s training, which is kind of a big loophole in our law. It’s a real problem. Nationwide, including both Americans and migrants, the U.S. courts showed a dramatic spike in its caseload for criminal traffic offenses in the 12 months before April 2023. “Filings for defendants charged with traffic offenses jumped 49 percent to 2,491 (this total does not include defendants charged with traffic crimes in petty offense cases disposed of by magistrate judges),” the courts’ report said. Auto insurance rates are lowest in low-migration states, including Maine, Idaho, and Vermont, and highest in Florida and Louisiana, according to an August report at USNews.com. The site ranked Ohio are the fourth cheapest state, but that is expected to change. Drivers in Nevada, for example, are facing a 30-percent increase by November, according to a September 11 report by 8NewsNow. “Last year was around 20, 30 bucks [per month],” driver Mesoud Rezaei told the outlet of his rate increase. “I don’t know why this year it’s raised a lot.” Insurify.com, which helps consumers find auto insurance, reported on August 11: Crime by poor or alienated migrants is also helping to raise insurance rates in the United States and Canada.",

    "title": "Anti-Mass Migration Freedom Party of Austria Wins Historic Victory in Parliamentary Elections",
    "author": "Kurt Zindulka",
    "content": "Establishment parties in Europe suffered another defeat on Sunday as the elections for the National Council in Austria saw the populist Freedom Party come in first place for the first time in history. Issues such as mass migration, the economic downturn throughout the EU, and growing opposition to support for the war in Ukraine propelled the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) to victory with an estimated 29.2 per cent of the total vote. The populist party led by firebrand former interior minister Herbert Kickl bested the governing neo-liberal Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP) led by Chancellor Karl Nehammer at 26 per cent, the left-wing opposition Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) at 21 per cent, the New Austria and Liberal Forum (NEOS) at nine per cent and the government coalition partner Green Alternative (GRÜNE) at eight per cent, according to Kronen Zeitung. Initial projections have the Freedom Party being allocated 58 seats in the National Council, followed by the ÖVP with 52, the SPÖ with 41. Trailing far behind, the liberal NEOS picks up 17 and the Greens 15 seats. The results mark the first time in the Second Republic of Austria, and the first time since the Freedom Party was founded in 1956, that the FPÖ came out on top of a national election. Intriguingly, there was almost no “gender gap” among Freedom Party voters, with nearly as many female voters (28 per cent) as male voters (30 per cent) backing the party, according to a snap survey by Austrian television networks ATV and Puls 24. The FPÖ meanwhile cleaned up in rural areas, small towns, and suburbs while the left performed best in big cities. Kickl, who stridently opposed coronavirus lockdown diktats and serves as a leading critic of the open borders agenda, having called for a “Fortress Austria” immediate halt of asylum seekers and unapologetically backing “remigration” policies of encouraging foreigners to return to their homelands, said after his victory Saturday that his party is ready to govern and that it will not back away from its positions. “My big thanks go to the citizens. It was not easy to go against this political system. The voter has delivered a powerful message,” the FPÖ leader said. While Sunday’s results is doubtless historic, the 29 per cent result is not considerably more than the FPÖ’s previous highs, taking 26 per cent in 1999. Yet that was in an era when the traditional ruling parties commanded more power nationally, and the winning party could take results in the high 30s or even low 40s. Today’s result is the lowest share for a first-place party since 2013, well short of an outright majority, which will make any hope for the FPÖ to build a governing coalition very low indeed. Far more likely are the legacy establishment parties coming together from left and right to build a FPÖ-blocking government to keep Kickl out of power, in a move that has become so familiar in other European states. Indeed, former Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern has already called for his Social Democrats and the soft-right People’s Party to work together in building a new government, Austria’s Kronen Zeitung notes. Meanwhile, present ÖVP Chancellor Karl Nehammer has already ruled out a coalition with the Freedom Party, saying that “it is not possible to make a coalition with a conspiracy theorist,” referring to Kickl. Now, the only question remains whether the legacy right and left-wing parties can put aside their little differences and agree to split up the government ministries between them. What is certain is the centre-right-green coalition that has ruled so far doesn’t have enough support to carry on. Even if the Chancellor manages to broker a new coalition, two losing parties coming together to block the victor and having a hard time navigating their differences in the public eye is all grist to Kickl’s mill, potentially setting him up in a stronger yet position for the next elections, particularly should the government collapse and a vote come early. As Austrian political scientists have stated, the attempt to demonise Kickl by the legacy parties has already brought him votes. Whether or not the Freedom Party enters the next government, populists across Europe have hailed the victory as another major stepping stone in transforming the political landscape in the EU. Geert Wilders, who serves as the main power player behind the Dutch government after leading his own party to a historic victory last year, wrote on X: “The Netherlands, Hungary, Belgium, Italy, Germany, Portugal, Sweden, France, Spain, Czech Republic and today Austria! “We are winning! Times are changing! Identity, sovereignty, freedom and no more illegal immigration/asylum is what tens of millions of Europeans long for!”. The FPÖ has previously governed in Austria as a junior government partner. Although subsequent revelations disarmed some of the key claims, that government collapsed in 2019 over the so-called ‘Ibiza Affair‘ over irregularities in party financing.",

    "title": "GRAPHIC: Sinaloa Cartel Gunmen Pack Bodies in Van as Hundreds Killed, Taken Amid Turf War",
    "author": "Ildefonso Ortiz and Brandon Darby",
    "content": "The impotence of Mexico’s military forces has become evident as gunmen with the Sinaloa Cartel continue a fierce turf war that led to almost 100 murders and 170 abductions. In the most recent show of force, gunmen left a van full of bodies with the message Welcome to Culiacan painted on the side. Over the weekend, cartel gunmen parked a white van packed with bodies in Culiacan, the state capital of Sinaloa. The bodies inside the van had all been wrapped in trash bags and showed signs of torture. According to information provided to Breitbart Texas by Mexican federal law enforcement sources, the bodies in the van all wore tactical-style clothing. They showed execution-style gunshot wounds to the head. Some of the bodies also showed various other gunshot wounds, pointing to the victims having taken part in a shootout. Mexican authorities haul away a van full of bodies left by cartel gunmen. (Credit: Breitbart Texas / Cartel Chronicles). The gory crime scene comes as the turf war between the Chapitos faction and the Mayos faction of the Sinaloa Cartel rages creeps into its third week after the violence began on September 9. According to official government figures, as of Friday, there have been 98 murders and 198 abductions in Sinaloa since the fighting started. However, the actual figures are believed to be much higher since Mexico’s government has been trying to minimize the violence and is believed to be undercounting the cases. Cartel gunmen left six bodies inside a van in Culiacan. (Credit: Breitbart Texas / Cartel Chronicles) Mexico’s outgoing President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who political rivals have repeatedly accused of being in bed with drug cartels, has blamed the violence on the U.S. government for having arrested Zambada. As Breitbart Texas has reported, the violence is tied to the July 25 capture of Sinaloa Cartel kingpin Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada at the hand of his godson Joaquin Guzman Lopez. The most current version of the capture points to Guzman and his brothers, the Chapitos, having called a meeting with top politicians and El Mayo at a ranch in Sinaloa. However, when El Mayo arrived, gunmen from Los Chapitos captured him, tied him up, and placed him in an airplane that flew straight to an area near El Paso, Texas, where U.S. federal agents were waiting for him.

    "author": "Wendell Husebo",
    "content": "Vice President Kamala Harris has not held a press conference on issues facing American families since joining the presidential race 71 days ago. Harris’s attempts to weave and dodge suggest her record is a political liability. President Joe Biden stated Wednesday that he delegated “everything” as commander in chief to Harris, including foreign policy and domestic policy. Harris had many chances to hold a press conference. Thursday was not an exception when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited Washington, DC. Taking no questions, Harris bolted from the podium and directed Zelensky out of the room. Harris has only conducted five television interviews, for which she faced a backlash for avoiding questions and failing to provide solutions to ongoing problems under the Biden-Harris administration. “As she is putting forward a ‘new way forward,’ she is currently in office,” RealClearPolitics White House reporter Philip Wegmann told Fox News. “She currently has access to the levers of power.” Since joining the race in July, Harris has allegedly changed her view, outright flip-flopped, or has an unknown position in 12 areas: More on Harris’s flip-flops is here.

    "title": "Exclusive: Fair Election Fund Launches Six-Figure Investigation to Stop Illegal Alien Voting",
    "author": "Sean Moran",
    "content": "The Fair Election Fund, an election integrity watchdog group, on Monday announced a six-figure investigation into noncitizen voting across seven swing states. Doug Collins, a Fair Election Fund senior advisor and former Georgia congressman, said in a written statement: Election integrity efforts depend on the accuracy and reliability of our voter databases. We’ve seen states like Texas and Virginia remove noncitizens from voter rolls, and other states must follow suit. While combing through voter rolls and conducting cross checks is a thankless task, it is essential work. The Fair Election Fund is ready to roll up our sleeves and take on this challenge to stop illegals from voting and ensure that every vote cast belongs to a U.S. citizen and resident of that state. The Fair Election Fund investigation will seek to ensure the integrity of elections across Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, and hopefully identify ineligible voters and subsequently remove them from the voter database. The investigation will compare the jury summons responses in the ten most populous counties in each of the seven swing states with their voters rolls to validate voter eligibility. If any of these cases exist, the Fair Election Fund will find them and immediately alert state authorities. This investigation begins this week and the Fair Election Fund will announce its findings by mid-October. The Fund started in May to expose fraud and abuse in the American election system. The group recently awarded $25,000 in bounties to concerned citizens in Nevada who reported information about union leaders forcing their members to vote a certain way. It also is investigating the Democrat donor platform ActBlue after seeing reportedly suspicious Biden and Harris campaign fundraising figures. Its investigation found 60,000 potential cases of fraud, which was turned over to Alabama, Nebraska, Kansas, Virginia, Tennessee, and Texas. When the group first formed, an ad said that the elections “are the bedrock of our American experiment.” “It’s part of our core, but we can only have confidence in the results if there is trust in the process. Across the country there are real cases and abuses in the system that have eroded our trust,” the narrator of the ad said. Sean Moran is a policy reporter for Breitbart News.

    "title": "Breitbart Business Digest: The Makings of a Second Trump Economic and Financial Boom",
    "author": "John Carney",
    "content": "Why Trump Being the Underdog Is Promising for the Economy A second Trump presidency is likely to unleash an explosion of economic growth that could surprise financial markets and officials at the Federal Reserve. This conclusion arises from a reading of surveys of voters, consumers, and businesses in recent weeks that indicate that uncertainty around the election—or even the prediction of a Vice President Kamala Harris win—is holding back economic activity and that Trump and the Republicans are more trusted on economic issues. Two months ago, Trump was clearly the favorite to win the election. The YouGov poll for the Economist in mid-July found that 52 percent of registered voters said Trump was likely to win. Harris was seen as the likely winner by just 31 percent of the public. The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment survey taken in the three months through July 17 had 48 percent forecasting a Trump win and 44 percent forecasting a Biden win. CNBC’s survey of chief financial officers found in the second quarter of this year that 58 percent said Trump would win, and only 12 percent said Biden would win. Each of those surveys now favors a Harris victory. The latest YouGov poll finds 40 percent of voters predicting Harris will prevail, with a Trump win at 35 percent. In the University of Michigan poll, 58 percent of consumers say Harris will win, and 34 percent say Trump will win. The CNBC CFO survey now has 58 percent saying Harris will win, and 31 percent forecasting a Trump victory. On the surface, that sounds like bad news for Trump. But keep in mind that these surveys are not always the most predictive, especially the survey of chief financial officers. These executives have not generally obtained their positions through the powers of their political forecasting abilities. In the September 2020 poll, two-thirds said Trump would win and just a quarter said Biden would. In the September 2015 survey of CFOs, 78 percent said Jeb Bush would win the GOP nomination and none—zero—said Trump would win. Consumers have done a bit better at predicting. Back in August of 2016, 69 percent of consumers predicted a win by Hillary Clinton and just 26 percent predicted a win by Trump. In 2020, however, consumers correctly predicted a Biden victory, with 48 percent saying they thought Biden would win and 47 percent saying Trump would win. Historically, consumers have a pretty good record of predicting the victory. The 2016 miss was a rare one. But consumer expectations and CFO expectations also have an impact on the economy. The latest CFO survey finds 55 percent saying Trump would be better for the economy, even though they expect he is going to lose. Given that scenario, we would expect to find that CFOs would begin to pull back on investment plans in reaction to a rise in the prospects for a worse economic policy. And sure enough, the Federal Reserve Banks of Richmond and Atlanta recently found that nearly one out of three CFOs have postponed, trimmed, or canceled investment plans because of the upcoming election. Similarly, most surveys of voters have found that Trump is seen as better on the economy than Harris. A recent Gallup poll, for example, found Republicans ahead of Democrats on the economy, with 46 percent saying the GOP is better and 41 percent saying Democrats are better. The University of Michigan survey found the opposite, with Harris ahead of Trump on economic issues, 41 percent to 38 percent, and tied on the question of who would be better for personal finances—but that has not been confirmed by other surveys. What this means is that a Trump victory would count as an upside surprise for CFOs and consumers. In the immediate aftermath of the election, there would likely be a positive reevaluation of the prospects for the coming years that would trigger more investment, more spending, and greater economic confidence. Does that sound familiar? It is exactly what happened in the aftermath of Trump’s unexpected win in 2016. The Index of Consumer Sentiment jumped from 87.2 in October, the final full-month reading before the election, to 98.2 in December, the first full-month reading after the election. This was the highest reading for the index since January 2004. An all-time record number of consumers spontaneously mentioned the expected favorable impact of Trump’s policies on the economy. “When asked whether they anticipated more or less economic growth during the year ahead, 43 percent expected better economic conditions in early December, up from 31 percent last month and 21 percent last year,” Richard Curtin, then the director of the survey, said. If Trump is able to once again upset the expectations of consumers and business leaders, it’s likely we will be looking at another Trump boom in markets and the economy.",

    "author": "Alana Mastrangelo",
    "content": "The Houston-based law firm The Buzbee announced they are representing more than 50 people accusing disgraced music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs and his associates of sexual assault and abuse. “The Buzbee Law Firm has been associated by the Ava Law Group to act as Lead Counsel to pursue claims on behalf of more than fifty individuals who suffered sexual assault and abuse at the hands of Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs and his cohorts,” the firm’s founder lawyer Tony Buzbee said on Thursday. “This group of brave individuals include both men and women; many were minors when the abuse occurred,” Buzbee continued. “Some of these brave individuals reported the incidents to the police, others did not. Each individual story is gut wrenching and heartbreaking.” The Texas attorney went on to say, “The acts complained of occurred at hotels, private homes, and also at the infamous PDiddy ‘Freak Off’ parties” “The violations against this group of individuals are mindboggling and can only be described as debauchery and depravity, exacted by powerful people against minors and the weak,” Buzbee added. A post shared by Tony Buzbee (@tonybuzbee) The lawyer also said he expects “the group seeking redress will grow as this case progresses.” “I expect many other individuals will be implicated,” he added. “We expect to have a press conference early next week where some of these stories can be told as the nation learns more and grapples with the potential scope of this scandal.” “Our firm has always been at the forefront of the most important cases in the United States. We are proud to represent this group of brave souls and pray for justice on their behalf,” Buzbee said. The attorney concluded his statement by urging anyone who has — or knows someone who has — been abused by Combs or his associates to come forward, assuring the public that a consultation with the law firm will remain confidential. “If you know of an individual seeking assistance who was abused as described above, please don’t hesitate to encourage them to contact our Firm. The consultation is confidential,” he said. Buzbee also told XXL, “On behalf of these brave individuals, I intend to sue Mr. Combs along with several other notable entities and individuals who were involved.” As Breitbart News reported, some of Combs’ parties, known as “Freak Offs,” allegedly involved dayslong sexual activity with sex workers and others who were given “a variety of controlled substances” to keep them “obedient and compliant,” according to a federal indictment. Combs allegedly arranged, directed, masturbated during, and electronically recorded “Freak Offs,” and would give victims “IV fluids to recover from the physical exertion and drug use,” the indictment alleges, adding that the music mogul would use the recordings “as collateral to ensure the continued obedience and silence of the victims.” The disgraced music mogul was arrested last week and accused of more than a decade of abusing, threatening, and coercing women and others, racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, and obstruction of justice, among other crimes. Combs has been charged with three counts: one charge of racketeering conspiracy; one charge of sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion; and one charge of transportation for purposes of prostitution. Combs, who has pleaded not guilty to the charges, is currently being held at Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn after being denied bail twice, and will have to remain in jail while he awaits his upcoming trial. He faces the possibility of life in prison if found guilty. Alana Mastrangelo is a reporter for Breitbart News. You can follow her on Facebook and X at @ARmastrangelo, and on Instagram.",

    "title": "Republicans See Red in Blue States, Pour Millions into Expanding Senate Map",
    "author": "Bradley Jaye",
    "content": "Senate Republicans will pour an additional $67.5 million into three Senate races against Democrat incumbents. The Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC closely allied with Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY), is going on offense with TV, radio, and digital ad buys in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday. WATCH — Trump Brings Back Jeb Bush “Low-Energy” Label for Pennsylvania Democrat Bob Casey: The group will spend $28 million in Pennsylvania, $17 million in Wisconsin, and $22.5 million in Michigan — three states also prioritized by Donald Trump’s campaign. “The consistent pattern we’ve seen is that these races are closing,” said Steven Law of the Senate Leadership Fund. Law previously served McConnell as chief of staff. In Pennsylvania, Republican Dave McCormick and Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) are in a virtual tie. In Wisconsin, where Trump and Harris are tied, Republican Eric Hovde has pulled within four points of Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI). In Michigan, former Rep. Mike Rogers continues to close the gap with Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI). Trump is tied or leading in all three battleground states. He won the trio in 2016 before Biden captured them in 2020. With a favorable map, strong candidates, and Trump at the top of the ticket, Republicans are almost guaranteed to gain seats in the Senate and eliminate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s (D-NY) 51-49 majority, but they’re looking for more than a simple majority. Democrats are playing defense across the country, while the only Republicans with competitive races are Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Rick Scott (R-FL). Both Cruz and Scott are favored. Sen. Joe Manchin’s (I-WV) retirement will hand West Virginia to Republicans. Republican Tim Sheehy is leading Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT) in conservative Montana, and Republican Bernie Moreno is giving Republicans in increasingly red Ohio hope to finally oust Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH). WATCH — CNN’s Enten: Harris Polling “The Worst Democrat Performance in a Generation” with Union Voters: Republicans are running other competitive races as well, including in Nevada and Arizona. Few would benefit more from Republicans running the Senate score up than Trump in a second term. Trump would need a friendly Senate to move legislation and, perhaps more importantly, judicial, cabinet, and other nominations. While nominations are only subject to a majority threshold, a handful of Senate Republicans, most notably Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Susan Collins (R-ME), would likely continue to be a thorn in Trump’s side. Additionally, the electoral map will be much more difficult for Senate Republicans in the 2026 cycle, meaning Republicans would be in less danger of losing the majority if they performed well during 2024. Notably, Law told the Journal that Harris’s pledge to eliminate the Senate filibuster to codify national abortion protections sparked a flurry of donations from major donors. That pledge immediately backfired with Sens. Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ) coming out strongly against it. McConnell is retiring from Senate leadership after this Congress but has much to gain if Republicans take the Senate. He would like to take over the powerful Appropriations Committee, reports indicate. Bradley Jaye is a Capitol Hill Correspondent for Breitbart News. Follow him on X/Twitter at @BradleyAJaye.",

    "author": "Dylan Gwinn",
    "content": "To say that this play did not unfold as it was drawn up would be a massive understatement. Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes overthrew a heavily-covered Travis Kelce in the first quarter of their game against the Chargers, and the ball landed in the hands of Los Angeles defensive back Kristian Fulton. As Fulton attempted to return the pick, Chiefs wide receiver Rashee Rice pursued the Chargers defender from behind to strip the ball. However, as he was pursuing from behind, his quarterback, Mahomes, came in to hit Fulton low and hit Rice in the knee. Rice was immediately ruled out for the rest of the game before being carted off the sidelines. “I feel terrible for Rashee,” he said. “We will hope for the best.” After the game, ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported that the Chiefs believe Rice tore his ACL. “Chiefs WR Rashee Rice is feared to have suffered a torn ACL during Sunday’s game vs the Chargers, per sources,” Schefter wrote. “There will be additional testing to confirm the initial diagnosis.” The official diagnosis of Rice’s knee will come Monday after an MRI.",

    "title": "‘I Thought We Were Playing Football’: Minkah Fitzpatrick Frustrated After Stunning Roughness Penalty",
    "author": "Dylan Gwinn",
    "content": "Steelers safety Minkah Fitzpatrick expressed frustration, and bewilderment after he was penalized for unnecessary roughness stemming from a hit on a defenseless receiver. The hit occurred in the third quarter of the Steelers game against the Colts. “I thought we were playing football,” Fitzpatrick said. “I don’t know what we’re playing at this point. Very different game than what I grew up playing and what I grew up loving. Can’t hit nobody hard, can’t be violent. So I don’t know. I don’t know what to say anymore.” The hit did not appear rough or unnecessary. Fitzpatrick’s job is to prevent Indianapolis’ Adonai Mitchell from catching the ball. In most cases, that necessitates contact. Moreover, his momentum to the receiver had already begun once Mitchell dropped his arms. Not only that, Fitzpatrick does not lower his shoulder and actually appears to pull up before the contact. Fitzpatrick continued, “They said he’s a defenseless player, and I hit him in the head. I don’t understand how he’s defenseless. If he’s going for the ball, I’m going to make a play on him or the ball. Just because he puts his arms down at the last second, [it] shouldn’t be a penalty. Didn’t hit him in the head either. But like I said, you hit people hard, and they throwing flags now. “I have every single right to go for the ball. If I don’t clean him and put my head into his head, it shouldn’t be a penalty. I’m allowed to go for the ball, just like he’s allowed to go for the ball, and I don’t even know how we’re supposed to play anymore.” The Steelers lost the game, 27-24.",

    "author": "Elizabeth Weibel",
    "content": "President Donald Trump will visit the city of Valdosta, Georgia, which was left devastated in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. In a press release issued on Sunday, the Trump campaign announced that Trump would be visiting Valdosta “to receive a briefing on the devastation” from the hurricane and to “facilitate the distribution of relief supplies.” “President Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America, will visit Valdosta, Georgia to receive a briefing on the devastation of Hurricane Helene, facilitate the distribution of relief supplies, and deliver remarks to the press on Monday,” the Trump campaign wrote. Valdosta Mayor Scott James Matheson confirmed to WALB that there have been three deaths reported as a result of Hurricane Helene. “So it’s three,” Matheson said in a statement to the outlet. “It’s three for us. And a lot more injury then we sustained than Idalia, a lot more injury for the penetration of the trees to roofs and houses as well.” Video footage posted to X by Billy Heath, a photojournalist with Fox5 Atlanta, showed damaged sustained to “historic buildings” in downtown Valdosta. Trump’s visit to Valdosta comes as communities in western North Carolina, such as the city of Asheville, experienced flooding and widespread devastation as a result of the hurricane. As of Sunday morning, the North Carolina Department of Transportation reported that there were “300 road incidents” remaining, which include more than “50 on main roads.” Video footage posted to X showed buildings, homes, vehicles underwater, roads, and bridges wiped away, in Asheville, and nearby areas, as a result of the rain and flooding from the hurricane. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R), and his wife Suzanne, were seen passing out sandwiches to first responders and residents of Darrow, Virginia, who were left affected by the hurricane.",

    "title": "Kris Kristofferson, Country Music Icon, ‘Blade,’ ‘A Star is Born’ Star, Dead at 88",
    "author": "Paul Bois",
    "content": "Legendary actor and country singer-songwriter Kris Kristofferson, most known for his roles in A Star is Born (1976) and Blade (1998), died at the age of 88 on Saturday. A representative for Kristofferson confirmed that the star died peacefully at his home in Maui over the weekend. In a statement, Kristofferson’s family said he’s “smiling down at us all.” “It is with a heavy heart that we share the news our husband/father/grandfather, Kris Kristofferson, passed away peacefully on Saturday, September 28 at home. We’re all so blessed for our time with him. Thank you for loving him all these many years, and when you see a rainbow, know he’s smiling down at us all,” the statement to PEOPLE said. Kristofferson, a child to first-generation Swedish immigrants, showed an interest in country music at an early age and formulated a band with fellow soldiers after serving in the U.S. military in the early-1960s. Speaking with Clash in 2010, Kristofferson said on the country music scene in Nashville, Tennessee at the time, “I just fell in love with the music community that was going on there. The way the old heroes helped out the new guys. It was a very soulful business at the time; I don’t know if it’s anything like that now. But it was definitely the best move I’ve ever made.” His music career would lead him to five Grammy wins, including a lifetime achievement award in 2014. Kristofferson later entered Hollywood to act in movies in the 1970s despite any formal training. “I’d never even been in no school play, but I read the [Cisco Pike] script, and I could identify with this cat, this dope dealer,” he told Rolling Stone in 1974. “People said, ‘Don’t do it, take acting lessons first!’ But it seemed to me that acting must be just understanding a character and then being just as honest as you can possibly be.” His big acting break came in 1976 when he starred alongside Barbara Streisand in A Star is Born where he played her self-destructive love interest – a role that would later be reprised by Bradley Cooper in the 2018 Lady Gaga star vehicle. In the 1990s, Kristofferson became a fan favorite for a new generation of movie lovers with his turn as the over-the-hill mentor Whistler in the Wesley Snipes blockbuster Blade, a role that he would reprise in the following two sequels. Kristofferson is survived by his wife Lisa, eight children and seven grandchildren.",

    "title": "Sen. Tom Cotton Calls Kamala Harris the Iranian Ayatollahs’ ‘Handpicked Candidate,’ Calls to ‘Let Israel Win’",
    "author": "Joshua Klein",
    "content": "Vice President Kamala Harris is the Iranian “Ayatollahs’ handpicked candidate,” according to Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton, who called for the elimination of “all of Hezbollah’s leadership” while insisting that the United States “should let Israel win” against Tehran’s key terrorist proxy in the region. In an interview on CBS News’s Face the Nation Sunday, Cotton, who sits on the Senate armed services and intelligence committees, expressed strong opposition to any ceasefire or de-escalation efforts in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. Noting that Israel has dealt a “huge blow” to Hezbollah’s leadership, he argued that now is the time for the U.S. to back Israel in fully neutralizing the group’s remaining capabilities. “I’m not sure that Israel’s expanding the war so much as it is trying to end the war,” he said, pointing to Hezbollah’s vast arsenal of over 100,000 rockets, missiles, and mortars aimed at Israel. He added that recent Israeli strikes have “devastated the entire leadership structure of Hezbollah,” including the killing of the group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah. Cotton stressed that the U.S. should support Israel in completely dismantling Hezbollah, asserting that the destruction of the group’s leadership and military capabilities would leave Iran vulnerable. “Iran has used [Hezbollah’s] threat to deter Israel for years … Now is not the time for a ceasefire or to de-escalate as Joe Biden and Kamala Harris want,” he continued, noting that Hezbollah is “on its knees.” “The United States should help Israel drive Hezbollah to the mat, choke it out, and finish it off once and for all,” he added, insisting that “we should let Israel win.” When asked if his support extended to a potential Israeli ground invasion of Lebanon, Cotton said he would endorse such an action if it were necessary to destroy Hezbollah’s remaining forces. “If that’s what Israel needs to do to eliminate the remnants of Hezbollah’s leadership and its arsenal, then yes, of course,” he replied. Cotton emphasized the importance of eliminating Hezbollah’s military infrastructure to prevent future threats, adding, “All of Hezbollah’s leadership needs to be eliminated, just like all of its arsenal needs to be eliminated.” Cotton also criticized the Biden administration’s response to Iranian aggression, particularly in Yemen and the Red Sea, where he claimed U.S. sailors have been left vulnerable to Iranian-backed forces: Just like the United States needs to be much more forceful in attacking Iran’s terror army in Yemen – where Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have had our sailors resting like sitting ducks on the Red Sea for months. When we finish mopping up all these terrorist proxies, that means Iran is once again totally exposed, and it can no longer threaten Israel, the United States, and our friends throughout the region. That’s why we need to back Israel to the hilt and let Israel win, rather than continue to make these feckless demands for ceasefires and de-escalation as Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have been doing for a year now. He described President Biden and Vice President Harris’s approach as one of appeasement, noting, “From the minute Joe Biden and Kamala Harris got to the White House, there have been threats to Americans,” and he called for a more forceful U.S. response. “Iran and its proxies have attacked our troops over 100 times, and we’ve barely ever struck back. There have been continued attacks on us,” he explained. “Again, just like we should support Israel in striking back against these terrorists, we should be striking back harder.” He then slammed the Biden administration’s failed approach to Iran. “But that’s Kamala Harris’ and Joe Biden’s policy. From the very beginning, they’ve appeased and conciliated the Ayatollahs,” he said. “Kamala Harris, for instance, opposed Donald Trump’s strike that killed Iran’s terrorist mastermind [Qasem Soleimani] in 2020.” Furthermore, he accused the Biden administration of enabling Iran’s actions. “Over the last four years, they’ve given away tens of billions of dollars in sanctions relief. They’ve looked the other way as Iran violates sanctions,” he said. “They’ve continually put more pressure on Israel than on Iran’s terrorist proxy.” “That’s why Kamala Harris is the Ayatollah’s handpicked candidate, and why the Ayatollahs are hacking into Donald Trump’s campaign and trying to kill him,” he added. The matter comes after President Biden called for a ceasefire in Lebanon again on Saturday evening, hours after the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was confirmed.

    "author": "Elizabeth Weibel",
    "content": "Georgia residents were told to evacuate or shelter in place after a chemical lab outside of Atlanta, Georgia, caught fire. In a post on Facebook, the Rockdale County Government wrote that a fire had “broken out” at the Bio Lab facility in Conyers, Georgia, and warned residents that evacuations were taking place for several locations, listing evacuation sites. Conyers is roughly under a 30-mile drive from Atlanta. “Please remain indoors and keep windows closed to minimize exposure,” the Rockdale County Government added in the post. Around 1:00 p.m. the Rockdale County Sheriff’s Office issued an update on Facebook that there had been a fire at the chemical plant earlier in the morning, adding that the fire had “reignited.” “At first, it was on fire earlier this morning, somewhere between four and four-thirty,” Rockdale County Sheriff Eric Levett said in a video. “The fire was contained, however, we were still dealing with the smoke. Now, the fire has reignited, and we are doing a hard evacuation.” Rockdale County Fire Chief Marian McDaniel explained during a press conference that the fire began “after a sprinkler head malfunctioned and mixed with a water-reactive chemical and wiring at the plant,” according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Video footage posted on social media showed smoke clouds from the chemical plant blowing into the sky. In one video posted to X, smoke from the chemical plant could reportedly be seen from someone’s window on a plane traveling from Washington, DC, to Atlanta. The fire is reportedly the “third such incident” the chemical plant has experienced within seven years, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

    "author": "Paul Bois",
    "content": "Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), the U.S. Democrat senate nominee, has warned that Vice President Kamala Harris may be “underwater” in her race against former President Donald Trump in Michigan. Speaking with donors at a fundraiser last Wednesday attended by Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), Slotkin said she is “not feeling my best right now about where we are on Kamala Harris in a place like Michigan,” a swing state that Trump won in 2016 before losing to Joe Biden in 2020. “We have her underwater in our polling,” Slotkin said in a video clip obtained by Axios. Slotkin did not provide exact polling numbers and gave no comment when pressed by Axios. The latest polls out of Michigan show that the race has been tightening between the two candidates, with Harris either holding a slim lead or Trump locked in a virtual tie. The FiveThirtyEight average of polls put Harris up by just two points in the state while a New York Times/Siena College poll put her up by one. Since both polls stand within the margin of error, the race could be best described as a virtual tie. During the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton stood ahead of Donald Trump by just three points around this time in September. As Breitbart News reported eight years ago: Donald Trump is within striking distance of Hillary Clinton in the deep blue state of Michigan, according to a poll by The Detroit Free Press and WXYZ-TV. Trump got 35 percent, while Clinton got only 38 percent in the poll of 600 likely Michigan voters, executed Sept. 10 through Sept. 13. Libertarian Gary Johnson followed with 10 percent and Green Party nominee Dr. Jill Stein polled at four percent. In a Trump v. Clinton two-way, Clinton leads Trump with 42 percent to his 38 percent. At the time, Trump had improved dramatically following an eight-point deficit in June of that year. However, around the same time in 2020, another poll put Trump ahead of Joe Biden in Michigan by 0.7 points before the former president went on to lose the state to Biden by just under three points — 50.62 percent to 47.84 percent. Unless either Trump or Kamala Harris pulls ahead dramatically in the Michigan race, the state will likely remain in the tossup category well into Election Day. As for Elissa Slotkin in her bid for senator, a recent Atlas Intel poll put her down 5.7 percentage points behind her Republican opponent Mike Rogers.",

    "title": "Trump Pokes Fun at Biden Playing Golf: ‘The Guy Can’t Play’",
    "author": "Elizabeth Weibel",
    "content": "Former President Donald Trump poked fun at President Joe Biden, pointing out that he “can’t play” golf. During a speech from Erie, Pennsylvania, on Sunday, Trump imitated Biden playing golf, and Biden’s claims that used to “drive an 18-wheeler.” “He said I used to fly jets too, if pilots came in, ‘I used to fly jets.’ If truckers came in, ‘I used to drive a truck.’ The worst of all though, was when he said, ‘I want to play him in golf.’ He wants to play me in golf. You ever see him play?” Trump proceeded to imitate Biden playing golf. “And Trump — but I’m a good golfer,” Trump added. “He said, ‘I wanna play him in golf, I’ll give him three strokes a side. I said, ‘Can you believe this? The guy can’t play!’ He never could! By the way, thirty, forty years ago he couldn’t play either.” Trump’s comments come after he previously challenged Biden to take part in a debate and an “18-hole golf match,” offering to donate $1 million to “any charity” if Biden won. The former president added that he would “give Joe Biden ten strokes a side.” During the presidential debate on June 27, between Trump and Biden, the two candidates argued over golf, with Biden claiming that while he was vice president under the Obama administration, he got his golf handicap “down to a six.” In response to Trump’s golf challenge, the Biden campaign issued a statement that Biden was too “busy leading America and defending the free world.” Biden previously claimed during an interview with Stephen Colbert that he had challenged Trump to a golf match, offering him “three strokes” if Trump could “carry” his own bag. During Trump’s speech in Pennsylvania, he also noted that the Democrats “would’ve been better” off if they had left “Biden in,” adding that Biden at least “had a base” compared to Vice President Kamala Harris. “I actually believe they would’ve been better if they left Crooked Joe Biden in, because I actually think, at least he had a base, she has no base,” Trump said. “You know, she was the last person, she came in last. Because when he ran, he got fourteen million votes, whatever you want. I’m not a big fan of his. I wouldn’t say he’s exactly the greatest. Do we agree? Not exactly the greatest, he doesn’t have any idea where the hell he is, but I think he’s better than she is.”",

    "author": "Warner Todd Huston",
    "content": "Actor John Asthon, who shot to fame in the 1980s smash hit Beverly Hills Cop, has passed. He was 76. Ashton starred as the long-suffering Detective Sergeant John Taggart who played foil to Eddie Murphy’s freewheeling Detective Axel Foley in the 1984 blockbuster that spawned three sequels. The actor’s passing was confirmed by his manager, Alan Somers, according to Fox News. “John was a loving husband, brother, father, and grandfather who will be deeply missed by all who knew him,” Somers said in a statement. “John leaves behind a legacy of love, dedication, and service. His memory will forever be treasured by his wife, children, grandchildren, as well as his brother, sisters, his extended family and all who loved him. John’s impact on the world will be remembered and celebrated for generations to come,” Somers added. The working actor died at his home in Ft. Collins, Colorado, with his wife, Robin Hoye. He leaves behind his two children and three step children. He also leaves behind a grandson. Ashton returned for the fourth entry in the Eddie Murphy series just this year by reprising his role in Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F which was released to Netflix in July. Actors Eddie Murphy, Judge Reinhold and John Ashton speak before the screening of “Beverly Hills Cop” during AFI & Walt Disney Pictures’ “A Cinematic Celebration of Jerry Bruckheimer” held at the Mann Chinese 6 on May 17, 2010 in Los Angeles, California. (David Livingston/Getty Images for AFI) Born Feb 22, 1948, in Springfield, Massachusetts, Ashton was raised in Connecticut before going to college in Southern California where he soon turned to acting. His first role in IMDB shows that on 1973 he performed on the film An Eye for an Eye, and oddly enough as a police sergeant. From there he took bit parts in a number of TV series through the 70s including, Emergency!, Columbo, Kojak, Barnaby Jones, Wonder Woman, MASH, and Police Story. He also had roles in films including Borderline, The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension, Some Kind of Wonderful, Curly Sue, Midnight Run, and Gone Baby Gone. “John was an avid reader and had many passions including acting, golf, and watching his favorite teams-the NY Yankees and NY Giants. However, it was his work as an actor/entertainer in theater, film and television where his skill and dedication were most clearly demonstrated. John devoted his career to honing his craft and bringing characters to life on the screen. His presence will be greatly missed,” his obituary states.

    "title": "Trump Slams Kamala Harris for ‘Repeatedly’ Vowing to ‘Ban Fracking’",
    "author": "Elizabeth Weibel",
    "content": "Former President Donald Trump criticized Vice President Kamala Harris for “repeatedly” vowing to “ban fracking,” during his speech in Erie, Pennsylvania, on Sunday. During his speech, Trump spoke about how Harris had “always” been “against fossil fuels,” and how if she was elected president in November, her policies on the Green New Deal would “obliterate the economy” of Pennsylvania. “When I win, we will get Pennsylvania energy workers, fracking, drilling, pumping, and producing like they have never produced before,” Trump said. “Lyin’ Kamala vowed to repeatedly ban fracking and she imposed a natural gas export ban. That was a killer that is starving your state right now of your wealth, and wealth that you deserve.” Trump’s words come as Harris has previously claimed that she never called for banning fracking. As Breitbart News previously reported, when Harris was running for president in 2019, she repeatedly called for an end to fracking. As Breitbart News previously reported, during a debate in the 2020 presidential primary, Harris stated that “there’s no question” that she was “in favor of banning fracking”: “There’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking,” Harris said on the debate stage. “And starting with what we can do on day one around public lands. There has to be legislation. Yes. This is something I’ve taken in California. I have a history of working on this issue … We just have to acknowledge that the residual impact of fracking is enormous in terms of the impact on the health and safety of communities.” Harris’s previous comments on banning fracking were recently questioned by CNN’s Dana Bash during an interview. Trump added during his speech that Harris’s “electric vehicle mandate” would “decimate” the state’s economy. “Her insane electric vehicle mandate will decimate Pennsylvania’s economy by abolishing gas powered cars and trucks for American roads, and destroying your fossil fuel industry,” Trump added. “There’s very few states that benefit like you do from fracking, you have 500,000 jobs.” During Trump’s speech, he pointed out that Harris had always been “against fossil fuels,” adding that she changed her views “because her poll numbers were bad.” “She was always against fossil fuels, she was born that way,” Trump said. “You don’t change. She just changed because her poll numbers were bad. You don’t change.” As Breitbart News has reported, Trump previously stated that if Harris is elected, Pennsylvania would not “have any energy jobs,” adding that “she’s never said frack in her lifetime.”",

    "author": "Amy Furr",
    "content": "Soap opera star Drake Hogestyn has passed away at 70 after his battle with pancreatic cancer. He would have celebrated his 71st birthday Sunday. The family of the “Days of Our Lives” actor shared the news and their grief in a post on the show’s social media account, USA Today reported Sunday. His loved ones said he faced his cancer diagnosis with “incredible strength and determination” and later “passed peacefully surrounded by loved ones. He was the most amazing husband, father, papa and actor”: Hogestyn delighted fans of the show as the character John Black for almost 40 years. In 2011, Hogestyn said he loved playing the character and tried for the part in 1986. “Over the course of 25 years, at one point or another I have referred to myself as 13 different identities in search of my true identity,” he said while detailing his career: The Fort Wayne, Indiana, native was a minor league baseball player until injuries kept him from playing. During his time on the soap opera, Hogestyn played Black, a policeman, a private investigator, and a secret agent, the Today report said. “The actor, a two-time hottest male actor winner in the Soap Opera Digest awards, appeared on the NBC and Peacock soap until his death, taking a short break from the show in the 2000s,” per the article. “He was a regular on the ‘80s TV series ‘Seven Brides for Seven Brothers’ and made guest appearances on the shows ‘Otherworld’ and ‘Criminal Minds.’ Most recently, he starred in the 2020 Hallmark movie ‘Christmas Tree Lane,'” it noted. According to TMZ, Hogestyn appeared in more than 4,000 episodes of the popular soap opera. “There are just a few standouts in soaps when it comes to romance, like Luke and Laura. Well, his character and Deidre Hall’s Marlena Evans is right up there,” the outlet added.",

    "title": "NFL Hall of Famer Emmitt Smith Joins ‘Athletes for Harris’ with Endorsement",
    "author": "Warner Todd Huston",
    "content": "Former Dallas Cowboys star Emmitt Smith has joined 14 other NFL Hall of Fame players in endorsing left-wing Democrat Kamala Harris’s run for the White House in the Harris campaign’s “Athletes for Harris” effort. Calvin “Megatron” Johnson, formerly of the Detroit Lions, and 1970s Minnesota Vikings star Alan Page are among the others who signed onto the vice president’s campaign. “America’s top athletes know a bad game plan when they see one — and there’s none worse than Trump’s Project 2025,” Harris-Walz Communications Director Michael Tyler said of the new campaign. “This endorsement will be critical in making the stakes of this election clear to those hard-to-reach voters and by tapping in the biggest legends of our time, our campaign is making one thing very clear: there is no time to sit on the sidelines.” Smith does not appear to have released any personal statement other than allowing his name to join the list of NFL players who have jumped onboard the Harris train. However, the ultra-woke Smith does have a history of supporting far-left ideas. For instance, he recently attacked the University of Florida for scrapping race-based diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. The other NFL players who signed on include Mel Blount, Kellen Winslow, Andre Tippett, Marv Levy, Drew Pearson, Kenny Houston, Jan Stenerud, Robert Brazile, Willie Roaf, Mike Haynes, Elvin Bethea, and Ron Mix. The “Athletes for Harris” campaign also includes the usual list of left-wing athletes, including its ten co-chairs: Magic Johnson, Billie Jean King, Steve Kerr, Ali Kreiger, Candace Parker, Doc Rivers, Dawn Staley, Ali Truwit, Chris Paul, and Thomas Booker. The endorsements spurred some sparring on social media: Follow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston, or Truth Social @WarnerToddHuston",

    "author": "Olivia Rondeau",
    "content": "The editor-in-chief of far-left magazine Mother Jones is facing a storm of backlash after attempting to smear an Alaska Airlines flight attendant participating in “creeping Christian nationalism” for wishing passengers a “blessed” evening. Clara Jeffery, who has been chief editor of the progressive publication since 2015, tagged the airline in a since-deleted X thread documenting her frustration with the employee: “Creeping Christian nationalism alert: @AlaskaAir flight attendant just wished us a ‘blessed’ night as we landed in SFO (!) to our groans,” she wrote. “Other adjectives that would have sufficed: great, awesome, fabulous, amazing, fantastic.” Jeffery also claimed that another passenger in her row said, “This ain’t Montgomery, sweetie” — seemingly referring to the Bible Belt city of Montgomery, Alabama. When confronted over her anti-Christian bigotry by fellow left-winger Armand Domalewski, the Mother Jones editor claimed the word “blessed” was disrespectful: “Eh. It’s a matter of respect for the audience before you,” Jeffery replied. “Respecting their space and norms and wishes. Dominant cultures always feel they have a right to enforce their norms and intents. And…way off @AlaskaAir’s brand.” Instead of responding to the public shaming of one of their employees, Alaska Airlines quietly untagged its X account from the thread. “How is an air flight attendant from Alaska offering you the rich lady from the richest place in America well wishes the dominating one in this situation?” asked journalist Zaid Jilani: It did not take long for other X users to search through Jeffery’s tweets, finding that she herself frequently says “God bless” and “blessed” to others: Just days before her meltdown over the word, Jeffery wrote, “Bless Gisèle Pelicot. Hero,” about the French woman who renounced her anonymity to expose her alleged rapists in an ongoing public trial. In 2019, Jeffery even said that she was “blessed” on another flight because the seat next to her was empty: “Is this Christian nationalism?” satirical parody page Dr. Richard Harambe asked. Other X users pointed out that Jeffery’s words could be seen as anti-black, as Montgomery is majority black as well as Christian: “I just want to point out that Montgomery, Alabama is 60% black,” said Atlantic contributor Tyler Austin Harper. “So it’s super fucking funny and progressive that the editor-in-chief of Mother Jones is shitting on a flight attendant for wishing her a blessed evening by offering ‘this ain’t Montgomery, sweetie’ as a witty quip.” “@ClaraJeffery accidentally outed herself as a classist racist and is lying in order to backtrack,” another user said:",

    "title": "VIDEO: Teen Gang Member Convicted in L.A. Double Murder Accused of Killing Again",
    "author": "Amy Furr",
    "content": "A 17-year-old gang member convicted in a double murder in Los Angeles, California, is accused of killing another person. After the two victims, identified as Alfredo Carrera and his friend, José Flores Velázquez, who had no gang connections, were killed for standing in a gang territory several years ago, Shanice Dyer was charged with premeditated murder by then-District Attorney Jackie Lacey, Fox 11 reported Saturday. An image shows the two victims: The East Coast Crips gang member was set to be tried as an adult. However, when District Attorney George Gascón took office in 2020 she was tried as a juvenile and in custody for under four years. “The same woman who killed Alfredo and Jose is now accused of murder once again, allegedly aiding and abetting in the murder of 21-year-old Joshua Streeter,” the report said. In a statement on Monday, Association of Deputy District Attorneys President in LA County Michele Hanisee detailed the cases and slammed Gascón: Streeter was gunned down in a parking lot at the Indian Hill Mall Indoor Swap Meet in Pomona. Dyer, who should have been incarcerated for life, was free—thanks to Gascón’s policies—and now another family is grieving the loss of their loved one. Streeter’s death could have been prevented, but Gascón’s commitment to releasing violent criminals like Dyer back onto the streets has once again resulted in tragedy. The failure here is not just Gascón’s policies, but his philosophy. The very foundation of justice is built upon accountability and ensuring that those who commit heinous acts are held responsible. Gascón has undermined this core principle repeatedly. In August 2022, a second attempt to recall Gascón failed, Breitbart News reported, noting the failure happened after “officials announced that there were not enough signatures to qualify the recall for the ballot, after observers were excluded from the count.” The article noted that when Gascón was elected in 2020, he had the backing of the Black Lives Matter movement, the Democrat Party establishment, and millions of dollars from left-wing billionaire donor George Soros.

    "author": "Olivia Rondeau",
    "content": "A California death row inmate was killed by fellow prisoners on Thursday, the state’s Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said. Alberto Martinez, 46, was beaten and struck with “incarcerated-manufactured weapons” in the attack carried out by Tyler A. Lua, Jorge D. Negrete-Larios, and Luis J. Beltran, officials said in a news release. Staff “quickly stopped the incident” with pepper spray and a baton strike and performed “life-saving measures” on Martinez, who was pronounced dead about an hour later. “Two incarcerated-manufactured weapons were found at the scene,” corrections authorities stated. “No staff or additional incarcerated individuals were injured.” All three accused perpetrators have since been placed on restricted housing units pending investigation, and the Imperial County Coroner will determine Martinez’s official cause of death. Martinez was a member of a Mexican mafia who was so powerful that he allegedly orchestrated murders from inside prison while using a contraband cell phone, the Los Angeles Times reported. Though California has not carried out an execution since 2006, he was placed on “condemned status” for first-degree murder and also had a life sentence for attempted first-degree murder with an enhancement for street gang activity and two years for street gang activity, the news release said. The three inmates suspected of killing Martinez are also hardened criminals, corrections officials said: Lua, 25, was received from San Bernardino County on Jan. 31, 2019, sentenced to 19 years for attempted second-degree murder with an enhancement for use of a firearm. While incarcerated, he was sentenced by Imperial County to two years for having a controlled substance in prison. Negrete-Larios, 33, was received from Riverside County on July 5, 2016, sentenced to 32 years, four months for attempted second-degree murder with enhancements for inflicting great bodily injury, discharge of a firearm and street gang activity in commission of a violent felony. Beltran, 31, was received from Los Angeles County on April 6, 2023, sentenced to life without parole for first-degree murder with enhancements for intentional discharge of a firearm causing great bodily injury/death, and possessing/owning a firearm as a felon. Shortly after his inauguration in 2019, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) signed an executive order imposing a moratorium on the death penalty and ordered the dismantling of the state’s execution chambers at San Quentin State Prison. A total of 623 inmates remain on condemned sentences in the state, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.",

This story has been updated to reflect the newly emerged photo. A post shared by Tim Walz (@timwalz) Story continues below. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) was pointing to Michiganders who were yelling “Trump 2024, baby” at him on Saturday. In a video posted to X, Walz, the vice-presidential running mate of Vice President Kamala Harris, was seen pointing to fans at the football game between the University of Michigan and the University of Minnesota after someone yelled, “Trump 2024, baby!” as he was walking by. Many people on social media responded to Walz pointing to Michiganders by criticizing his behavior so close to a “pivotal election.” Walz pointing to Michiganders off comes after he was booed outside of the Michigan-Minnesota game. In a video posted on TikTok, a crowd of people were seen outside of the stadium booing Walz, with one person yelling, “Get that b***h out of here.” Michigan ended up defeating Minnesota 27-24. Walz’s attendance at the college football game came the same day that former President Donald Trump attended the football game between the University of Alabama and the University of Georgia, where he received a loud welcome and was seen interacting with crowds of people at the game.",

    "author": "Amy Furr",
    "content": "The Democrat party’s advantage with Latino voters is apparently declining, the news coming as Americans gear up to head to the polls for the November presidential election. A national NBC News/Telemundo/CNBC poll found that Vice President Kamala Harris (D), who is campaigning alongside radical leftist Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), is leading former President Donald Trump among Latino voters, NBC News reported Sunday. WATCH — Maher: Dems “Actually Kind of Racist” on Border Security, “Don’t Seem to See Latinos as Americans”: “But that advantage has declined to Democrats’ lowest level in the past four presidential cycles,” the article said, citing the poll. It added that the poll shows Harris has lost ground with Latinos who are giving Trump an advantage when it comes to the economy and the rising cost of living. The report continued: Support for Harris is at 54% among registered Latino voters, according to the poll, while Trump gets 40% and another 6% say they’re unsure or wouldn’t vote. The margin of error in the poll is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. While Harris’ 14-point advantage is an improvement from President Joe Biden’s standing when he was at the top of the ticket, it is still lower than the past leads Democratic presidential candidates enjoyed in 2012 (by 39 points), 2016 (50 points) and 2020 (36 points), according to NBC’s merged polling data from those past cycles. WATCH — Rep. Mayra Flores: Dems Think They Can Trade Tacos for Latino Votes: Another recent poll found that Trump, whose running mate is Sen. JD Vance (R-OH), leads Harris in key swing states Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia, and Arizona, Breitbart News reported Saturday. A Wall Street Journal analysis found in early September that Harris was unable to claw back Trump’s gains with black, Latino, and young voters, per Breitbart News. “The analysis is significant because the Democrat Party hoped President Joe Biden’s decision to step aside for Harris would restore key voting blocs in favor of its nominee,” the article read. An Equis poll released in June found that Latinos trust Trump more than Biden when it came to immigration, per Breitbart News.",

    "author": "David Ng",
    "content": "Actor Zachary Levi — who starred in the Shazam! movies — has endorsed former President Donald Trump, saying he believes Trump is the candidate who can successfully “take back this country.” Zachary Levi moderated a panel of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard at a “Reclaim America” tour stop on Saturday in Dearborn, Michigan. The actor said he had endorsed RFK, Jr. earlier in the election cycle because the candidate embodied his own distrust of government and unscrupulous corporations. “I stand with Bobby and I stand with everyone else who is standing with President Trump,” he said. “My parents were Kennedy Democrats that then turned into Reagan Republicans,” Levi said. “And they taught me to have a healthy level of distrust for the government and a healthy level of distrust for industry that runs amok.” He added: “We live in a country that’s been hijacked by a lot of people who want to take this place off the cliff… We’re here to stop that. We’re here to make sure we are going to take back this country.” Later, the actor blasted the establishment news media, the pharmaceutical industry, and big agriculture. “We are all being poisoned and lied to,” he said. Both RFK, Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard have endorsed Trump’s bid to re-take the White House and are hitting the campaign trail for Trump in the weeks leading up to November 5. Both are former Democrats who have become independents after experiencing the dirty tricksDemocrat elites played in their efforts to smear and discredit them.

The Sooners were taking the field at Jordan-Hare Stadium in Auburn when an Auburn cheerleader decided it was time to entertain the crowd with a series of backward handsprings. The only problem? His gymnastic path took him directly to the middle of Oklahoma’s line of players. So close! Incredibly, the Auburn back-flipper almost made it through the entire Oklahoma entourage before flipping into Vickers. It’s all good, though, as neither the Vickers nor the cheerleader were hurt.

Even though it was already spotted from Earth, the comet is expected to swing back around its orbit from the Sun and possibly become visible again October 12-20. “During this time, Comet C/2023 A3 will climb higher in the sky each night and will slowly fade in visibility as it continues its journey out of the solar system,” the scientific outlet reported.",

After the bout, the outspoken Brazilian professional mixed martial artist grabbed the mic and admitted to talking smack about France, but insisted that the French people in general are great. It’s just that their government “sucks,” he said. “France, I come here, and I wanted to talk a lot of shit about France. But, I went to the Louvre, I went to all beautiful places in Paris, and I had just one thing to say. French Revolution tried to erase God from the map, but guess what? Jesus Christ is life,” he exclaimed. Fuck [French President Emmanuel] Macron. Fuck all globalists. Fuck all these motherfucking globalists,” Moicano went on. “They try to push for a political, corrupt agenda… I advise you read Democracy: The God That Failed [by] Hans-Hermann Hoppe and I hope that you understand that democracy is a fallacy. Democracy is not the real government. So please read Hans-Hermann Hoppe’s [book] and understand why the world is going crazy like that today,” he finished. “Money Moicano” also said he wants to take on Paddy Pimblett and Dan Hooker next because they would be “easy money” for him. While Moicano may not want any “tough” opponents, he certainly proved that he was tough himself. After the fight, it was revealed that he was fighting with a broken shoulder. Indeed, the Brazilian pugilist said that he has been battling pain from this injury for nearly a month already.

Part of that is the gender gap with women who say they don’t trust you or him the GOP with the issues of abortion or IVF.” She asked, “How can the GOP, is it possible to fix it? Because women just don’t trust you guys on that one.” Britt said, “We are going to continue I think to grow in the polls here and as we’re going to talk with these issues and get a message out to voters, they will see where President Trump stands on this. There’s been no stronger supporter of IVF then President Trump. If you think about what occurred in Alabama President Trump came out immediately and said he strongly supported IVF and he wanted the legislature to act. They acted in six days. Our Republican legislature and Republican governors signed IVF protection into law. We continue to talk about this.” She added, “The truth is Democrats continue to use this issue as a scare tactic because IVF is legal and accessible in all 50 states.” Follow Pam Key on X @pamkeyNEN",

    "title": "Veteran Hollywood Professionals Experience Unemployment, Evictions After Writers’ Strike",
    "author": "Olivia Rondeau",
    "content": "An experienced actor and aerial cinematographer went from being at “the heart of Hollywood’s golden age of streaming” to worrying about affording “a value meal at McDonald’s,” the BBC reported in a piece on how the industry’s writers’ strike impacted everyone else. Before living on the brink of homelessness, Michael Fortin had built a successful business by transforming his hobby of flying drones into a service used to capture aerial shots for content hosted on major platforms such as Netflix, Disney, and Amazon Prime. According to his LinkedIn, Fortin has run his company, CineDrones, in the Los Angeles area for over 12 years. CineDrones was operating “nearly every day” before the Writers Guild of America (WGA) — representing 11,500 screenwriters — went on strike over a dispute with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) in May 2023, BBC reported. After the strike ended in September 2023, Fortin’s business did not pick back up. He has flown drones on only 22 days since. In his side career as a background actor, he has only worked 10 days. The cinematographer, along with his wife and two children, were evicted from his Huntington Beach home when they could no longer afford to stay in California. Now, they are about to be evicted from their Las Vegas apartment. “It was a great wave, and it crashed,” Fortin told the U.K. outlet after landing his first drone gig since April. “Things are coming in little by little,” he added, as he prepared to drive from the set in southern California back to Vegas to fight his eviction order in court. Even with credits on notable television shows including NCIS: Los Angeles, The Grand Tour, and SEAL Team, Fortin’s business has never regained the volume of work it had prior to the strike. Explaining just how far he had fallen, Fortin spoke of how his family went from being financially comfortable to finding himself in dire straits. “We were saving to buy a house, we had money, we had done things the right way,” he said. “Two years ago, I didn’t worry about going out to dinner with my wife and kids and spending 200 bucks… Now I worry about going out and spending $5 on a value meal at McDonald’s.” The problems are not just impacting CineDrones — the industry is down across the board. The total number of productions being filmed in the U.S. dropped by nearly 40 percent in the first half of 2024 compared with the same period in 2022, data from ProdPro revealed. Across the globe, a 20 percent drop was seen during that period. On Tuesday, television network Paramount announced it would be laying off 15 percent of its workforce, Breitbart News reported. “In order to set Paramount up for continued success, we are taking these actions, and after today, 90% of these reductions will be complete,” Paramount co-CEOS George Cheeks, Chris McCarthy, and Brian Robbins said in a memo sent to employees, as reported by The Wrap. In April, it was reported that many other Hollywood workers had resorted to bartending and delivering food to make ends meet in the crashing industry. “Hollywood gave me everything,” Fortin said. “But it feels like the industry has turned its back on lots of people, not just me.”",

    "title": "Norway Looks to Build Border Fence with Russia to Prevent Moscow Using Migrants in ‘Hybrid Warfare’",
    "author": "Breitbart London",
    "content": "HELSINKI (AP) – Norway may put a fence along part or all of the 198-kilometer (123-mile) border it shares with Russia, a minister said, a move inspired by a similar project in its Nordic neighbor Finland. “A border fence is very interesting, not only because it can act as a deterrent but also because it contains sensors and technology that allow you to detect if people are moving close to the border,” Justice Minister Emilie Enger Mehl said in an interview by the Norwegian public broadcaster NRK published late Saturday. She said the Norwegian government is currently looking at “several measures” to beef up security on the border with Russia in the Arctic north, such as fencing, increasing the number of border staff or stepping up monitoring. The Storskog border station, which has witnessed only a handful of illegal border crossing attempts in the past few years, is the only official crossing point into Norway from Russia. Should the security situation in the delicate Arctic area worsen, the Norwegian government is ready to close the border on short notice, said Enger Mehl, who visited neighboring Finland this summer to learn about how the entire 1,340-kilometer (830-mile) Finnish-Russian land border was closed. The Finnish government was prompted to close all crossing points from Russia to Finland in late 2023 after more than 1,300 third-country migrants without proper documentation or visas – an unusually high number – entered the country in three months, just months after the nation became a member of NATO. To prevent Moscow using migrants in what the Finnish government calls Russia’s “hybrid warfare,” Helsinki is currently building fences with a total length of up to 200 kilometers (124 miles) in separate sections along the border zone that makes up part of NATO´s northern flank and serves as the European Union´s external border. Finnish border officials say fences equipped with top-notch surveillance equipment – to be located mostly around crossing points – are needed to better monitor and control any migrants attempting to cross over from Russia and give officials time to react. Inspired by Finland’s project, Enger Mehl said that such a fence could also be a good idea for Norway. According to NRK, her statement was supported by police chief Ellen Katrine Hætta in Norway’s northern Finnmark county. “It’s a measure that may become relevant on all or part of the border” between Norway and Russia, Enger Mehl said. The Storskog border station is currently surrounded by a 200-meter (660 feet) long and 3.5-meter (12 feet) high fence erected in 2016 after some 5,000 migrants and asylum-seekers had crossed over from Russia to Norway a year earlier.",

    "author": "Pam Key",
    "content": "Former Attorney General Eric Holder said Sunday on MSNBC’s “Inside” that former President Donald Trump was in “cognitive decline.” Holder said, “He has never been a master of the English language, but if you look back four years ago and eight years back, his sentences are shorter, they make less sense, his paragraphs are more garbled. He seems to be more out of touch with the questions asked of him and the way in which he formulates his responses just don’t seem to be cogent. He doesn’t have many policy positions that he would ever talk about. He just seems to me to be a person who seems to be a little bit more confused than perhaps he was four years ago. I am not saying he was spectacular four years ago or four years before that but even against those lowered standards, he doesn’t seem to meet the standards, those lower standards he was judged by just a few weeks ago or years ago, he doesn’t meet those.” He added, “The Trump playbook is when you don’t have the specifics or you don’t have the ammunition to actually go after somebody on their policies or go after them in a substantive way, you go back to eighth and ninth grade kind of stuff for you start to call people names. Talking about her mental stability or inability to do certain things, I think it is both projection on his part but also an indication of, again, the cognitive decline where he doesn’t have the ability to mount a substantive challenge to the person he is running against. I think that is something the American people need to take into consideration. Donald Trump made a great deal of the cognitive abilities of Joe Biden. We now have the person on the Republican side who is the oldest person ever to run for President of the United States.

    "title": "Minneapolis Swears In First Non-U.S. Citizen as Police Officer",
    "author": "Warner Todd Huston",
    "content": "Minneapolis, Minnesota, has sworn in its first police officer who is not a U.S. citizen, according to reports. The Minnesota Police Dept. has reported that Lesly Vera, a native of Somalia, was sworn in on Thursday as the department’s first non-citizen officer. Vera was seen at the swearing-in ceremony wearing a hijab over her head as she took the oath of office and received her badge. Vera moved to Minneapolis with her parents from their arrival point in Mexico when she was four. She is a legal resident alien and authorized to work, but is not a U.S. citizen. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara defended the idea of giving police powers to a non-citizen. “There may be people who question it, but that’s completely ridiculous. There’s, like I mentioned, there is a history in this country of people immediately on arrival to the country, enlisting in the military and serving,” O’Hara told KSTP-TV. “Somebody like [Officer Vera], who has been here essentially her entire life, absolutely is entitled to protect her community in the same way that anyone else here has, and we’re honored to have her.” WATCH — Rep. Donalds: Tim Walz Should Apologize to Minneapolis for Allowing Rioters to Burn It Down: “Our 23 new officers include the first Somali-American woman to join the department and the first permanent resident. A police service that looks like our residents is better able to serve our residents, and I couldn’t be more proud of the department we’re building under Chief O’Hara,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (D) said Friday on Facebook. “It’s moving. It’s emotional. I mean, I talked about the hope in the room, from a personal standpoint as mayor of the city, it gives me a lot of hope. Our police department is looking more and more like the communities that we are charged with protecting and serving,” Frey added in a KTSP interview. The Somali migrant community in Minneapolis is the largest in the United States and the city has been a target of Somali migration since the 1990s. Somalis were drawn to the city for its generous welfare programs and the chance to live as ex-pats among their own countrymen, but the community has recently been rocked by a massive fraud case entailing tens of millions in stolen Medicaid funding connected to a fake charity called Feeding Our Future run by leading local Somali residents. WATCH — Harris Campaign Dodges on Her Dodge on Defund the Police: The door was opened for Vera last year when the Minnesota Board of Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) adopted new rules that allowed state law enforcement agencies to elevate non-citizens to the role of police officer. The citizenship requirement was dropped and applicants now only need to be a legal resident and cleared to work in the U.S. to be handed a gun and badge. Minnesota is not the only state working to allow non-citizens to become police officers. California, Colorado, and Illinois are also crafting legislation to give non-citizens police powers. Minneapolis was rocked in 2017 when police officer and Somali-native Mohamed Noor shot and killed an Australian woman while responding to a 911 call. Officer Noor was eventually convicted of third-degree murder and manslaughter, though the state Supreme court later vacated the third-degree conviction. Ultimately, Noor was sentenced to 57 months for murdering the woman. The city received widespread criticism over the move on social media. X chief Elon Musk, for one, was disturbed by the news that a non-citizen was given powers to detain, arrest, and jail citizens. Musk likened the situation to the fall of the Roman Empire, adding that “the Roman Army also increasingly relied on non-citizens.” Follow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston, or Truth Social @WarnerToddHuston",

Hey, she’s a prosecutor, she’s a border senator, a border attorney general. She knows how to handle these issues.

We actually had the deal, and then he told them that they had to walk away from this because Donald Trump doesn’t want to solve this problem. He just wants to talk about problems.” He added, “So, yeah. She’s prepared on day one to deal with this issue. She said she would sign that legislation into law. It’s up to us in the Senate, myself, Senator Rubio and others, to bring that legislation back and send it to her desk.” Follow Pam Key on X @pamkeyNEN",

    "author": "John Nolte",
    "content": "Disney decided to publicize the Marvel streaming series Agatha All Along as the “gayest Marvel project” ever, one full of “gay explosions,” and guess what happened? No, go ahead, guess… Headline: “Agatha All Along Ratings Crash Below Canceled The Acolyte On Disney Plus: Media Run with Misleading Numbers HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA *deep breath* HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!! That Park Place did the math and found this hidden beneath the corrupt entertainment media’s spin: Variety stated, “The opening of Agatha All Along appears to be roughly on par with that of Percy Jackson and the Olympians, which debuted with 13.3 million views in six days, as well as The Acolyte, the Star Wars series that hit 11.1 million views in five days. … If we divide the viewership measured for The Acolyte by the number of days for which we are given [five], we discover that The Acolyte averaged 2.22 million views per day in its first five days. If we divide the viewership measured for Agatha All Along by the number of days for which we are given [seven], Marvel’s new series only picked up 1.32 million. In other words, per diem, Agatha All Along only nabbed 59.5% of The Acolyte’s viewership for the days which we have been provided. [emphasis original] To pretend the series is popular, the corrupt media are comparing Agatha All Along’s seven-day viewership total to the six-day numbers for Percy Jackson and the five-day numbers for the already-canceled The Acolyte — which was itself a massive flop after being publicized as the “gayest Star Wars ever.” Again and again, audiences have rejected at a 100 percent rate all this woke and gay crap, but these arrogant Hollywood propagandists continue to produce it. Worse, they deliberately alienate people by using the homosexual angle to publicize the show or movie. Why? Because they know it sucks and this gives them a way to blame their flop on homophobia. You cannot rewire human nature. It can’t be done. An overwhelming number of people are straight and are therefore made uncomfortable by homosexuality. We are born this way, and it is not something we will ever get used to. Note, that I said we are made uncomfortable by “homosexuality” and not “homosexuals.” Gay characters are fine — as long as they are included organically and not as obvious tokens to appease the Woke Gestapo. Last week, I saw a pretty good horror movie called The Invitation (2015). The story is set in the Hollywood Hills, so it made sense for a male gay couple to be there. There was nothing sexual. The characters were well-rounded. Who cares if they were gay? I didn’t. Hollywood should make movies and TV for everyone, including gay people. But gay movies and TV are not for everyone. Sorry, they just aren’t. If homophobia is defined as covering one’s eyes when two men kiss, I’m homophobic as hell. In my defense, I have no issue with hot lesbians. I can watch that all day long … and have. Homophobic? Me? I don’t think so. John Nolte’s first and last novel, Borrowed Time, is winning five-star raves from everyday readers. You can read an excerpt here and an in-depth review here. Also available in hardcover and on Kindle and Audiobook.",

    "title": "Gov. Brad Little Cheers Boise State Women’s Volleyball for Canceling Game Against Team with Trans Player",
    "author": "Lara Gwinn",
    "content": "Republican Idaho Gov. Brad Little cheered Boise State University women’s volleyball after the team’s decision to forfeit their Saturday game against San José State, who “quietly” added a trans player to their team in April. Little applauded the team for ensuring “player safety” and continuing “the fight for fairness in women’s sports.” “I applaud @BoiseState for working within the spirit of my Executive Order, the Defending Women’s Sports Act,” Little posted on Friday, along with the statement from Boise State volleyball. “We need to ensure player safety for all of our female athletes and continue the fight for fairness in women’s sports.” In April, Breitbart News revealed that “San Jose State University has very quietly added a transgender player to its women’s volleyball team without alerting opposing teams or the new player’s teammates that he was born a male.” The player, Blaire Fleming, who was born Brayden, is reportedly the only transgender player in the Division I Mountain West Conference. Boise State released a statement Friday announcing their decision to decline the match: Boise State volleyball will not play its scheduled match at San José State on Saturday, Sept. 28,” the statement said. “Per Mountain West Conference policy, the Conference will record the match as a forfeit and a loss for Boise State. Little signed the Defending Women’s Sports Act in August, and said at a press conference that “biological males have physical differences that give them an unfair advantage when competing with women and girls in sports.” WATCH — Riley Gaines: I Want No Girl to EVER Have to “Compare Themselves Physically to a Male” in Sports: The governor also signed legislation in 2023 that bans boys who identify as girls from using girls’ restrooms in public schools. Additionally, Sen. Jim Risch (R-ID) commended the team for “taking a stand for women,” writing on Friday, “Kudos to @BoiseState for taking a stand for women in sports! Idaho’s hardworking, talented female athletes deserve a fair playing field where they can compete and WIN.” WATCH — Maher: We’ve Gone from Title IX Giving Women an Equal Shot to “Let’s Put a Male in the Swimming Pool with the Women”: Since Fleming joined the team, there have been complaints from concerned parents about the safety of their daughters while competing in volleyball at Boise State, and a former teammate filed a lawsuit calling for the NCAA to take action against male players such as Fleming, citing his “80 mph” spikes that put “women’s health and safety in danger.” Breitbart News reported: Fleming’s former teammate, Brooke Slusser, has joined women’s sports advocate and former Kentucky swimmer Riley Gaines in suing the NCAA for permitting male players to compete in women’s sports. “Brooke estimates that Fleming’s spikes were traveling upward of 80 mph, which was faster than she had ever seen a woman hit a volleyball,” Slusser’s complaint said, via the Cowboy State Daily. “The girls were doing everything they could to dodge Fleming’s spikes but still could not fully protect themselves.” “One thing that’s important in this case is really the physical safety issues in volleyball,” Slusser’s attorney, Bill Bock, told OutKick. “And that’s what they’re facing in practice every day. So, it’s just a crazy, misguided policy that steals athletic dreams from women and gives them to men, and, at the same time, puts women’s health and safety in danger.” The Boise State Broncos’ next game will be October 3 against Air Force.",

    "content": "Former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation” that he is running for the U.S. Senate because people are fed up with former President Donald Trump’s “divisive rhetoric.” Host Robert Costa said, “Former President Donald Trump, who in recent days on the campaign trail has attacked vice president harris and he’s said she has mental issues. he has said thing after thing, questioning her intelligence, her ability. Do you believe former President Donald Trump is fit for office or not?” Hogan said, “I think all of that is outrageous and unacceptable and I’ve’ already called him out when he had the one interview he was questioning her racial identity and now he’s questioning her mental competence. I think that’s insulting not only to the vice president, but to people that actually do have mental disabilities. You know, I’ve said for years that Trump’s divisive rhetoric is something that we could do without. I think he’s his own worst enemy. I think, you know, I’m very concerned about the toxic and divisive politics that seems to continue really back and forth. It’s what people are so fed up with. It’s why they want to change Washington and it’s why I’m running.” He added, “I think we need to get the country back on track. I’m standing up. I’ll stand up to the current president, the former president, or the next president when I think they’re wrong. I’ll work with them when I think they’re right. I’ll stand up to the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. It’s what I’ve done my entire career.” Follow Pam Key on X @pamkeyNEN",

    "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
    "content": "The Israel Defense Force (IDF) carried out airstrikes against the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen on Sunday, the second such attack since July, in response to several ballistic missiles fired by the rebels at Israel in recent days. The IDF said in a statement: Today (Sunday), during an extensive, intelligence-based aerial operation, dozens of IAF aircraft—including fighter jets, mid-air refueling aircraft, and intelligence aircraft struck military targets belonging to the Houthi terrorist regime in the Ras Isa and Hudaydah areas of Yemen. The targets included power plants and a seaport used to import oil, which were used by the Houthi terrorist regime to transfer Iranian weapons to the region, in addition to military supplies and oil. The strikes were carried out in response to the recent attacks by the Houthis against the State of Israel. Over the past year, the Houthis have been operating under the direction and funding of Iran, and in cooperation with Iraqi militias in order to attack the State of Israel, undermine regional stability, and disrupt global freedom of navigation. The IDF is determined to continue operating at any distance – near or far – against all threats to the citizens of the State of Israel. One of the Houthi missiles had landed near an Israeli town in Judea and Samaria (also known as the West Bank). There were also unconfirmed reports that a helicopter carrying senior Houthi officials had crashed in Iran on Sunday. Joel B.

    "title": "Texas Moving to Force Tren de Aragua Gang Out of State, Says Gov. Abbott",
    "author": "Bob Price",
    "content": "Texas Governor Greg Abbott told Breitbart News he is making all available tools available to law enforcement to take action against the violent Venezuelan Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang. The governor said the gang members will find their operations in Texas will become unprofitable, forcing them to leave the Lone Star State. “If you look at the historical analysis written about them (TdA), they’re in a business operation,” Governor Abbott told Breitbart Texas in an exclusive interview on Friday. “They’re looking to make money. And what they’re going to find is, if they’re coming in the state of Texas, they’re losing money. It’s a losing money proposition in the state of Texas, and they’re going to realize they got to take their business elsewhere.” Governor Abbott recently designated the Venezuelan prison gang as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, unleashing additional law enforcement tools to be employed against TdA gang members. Abbott told Breitbart the designation allows the State to seize properties acquired by the TdA gang for use as human smuggling stash houses and other operational venues. “The reason why that’s meaningful here is because their standard method of operation is that they will find a house or some other type of building or location that they will use as a stash house for purposes of trafficking people,” the Texas governor explained. “And it allows us to use this tool to shut down those physical properties that they’re using.” The governor added that the designation also increases jail penalties “so that when we do arrest them, they’re going to be behind bars a very long time.” Recently, Texas DPS troopers arrested 20 suspected TdA gang members on charges relating to their takeover of the Gateway Hotel in El Paso, Breitbart Texas reported. The members of the violent Venezuelan gang are charged with a variety of state crimes, including human smuggling, prostitution, and drug possession. During the interview, Abbott mentioned the arrest of two more TdA gang members in the San Antonio area last week. In August, a Texas Department of Public Safety trooper arrested a confirmed Tren de Aragua, who was released by the Biden-Harris administration. The TdA gang member is charged with smuggling of persons. The Venezuelan gang member was wearing an ICE tracking device at the time of his arrest. This was his second arrest on human smuggling charges, Breitbart Texas reported. Abbott told Breitbart that Tren de Aragua operates in El Paso, San Antonio, Houston, Dallas, and the Rio Grande Valley border region. In addition to the foreign terrorist organization designation, Abbott also offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the identification and arrest of TdA gang members. During Fiscal Year 2020, President Donald Trump’s last full year in office, Border Patrol agents apprehended only 465 Venezuelan migrants who crossed from Mexico into the five Texas-based sectors. During the first year of the Biden-Harris administration, a dramatic increase in crossings led to the apprehension of nearly 68,000 Venezuelan migrants. From FY21-FY24 year-to-date, Border Patrol agents apprehended nearly 499,000 Venezuelan migrants who illegally entered the United States in the five Texas-based Border Patrol Sectors, Texas DPS officials reported. “Our goal is to make sure we find them, identify them, locate them, arrest them, and lock them up,” Abbott stated during the Friday interview.

    "title": "Donald Trump: ‘Joe Biden Became Mentally Impaired, Kamala Was Born that Way’",
    "author": "Wendell Husebo",
    "content": "Vice President Kamala Harris was born “mentally impaired,” former President Donald Trump said Saturday in Wisconsin, mocking his political opponent and highlighting the nation’s managed decline. “Joe Biden became mentally impaired. Kamala was born that way,” Trump said to loud applause. “And if you think about it, only a mentally disabled person could have allowed this to happen to our country”: Trump repeatedly slammed Harris for soaring prices, the southern border invasion, and foreign policy blunders such as the deadly Afghan withdrawal and the Russian/Ukrainian war. President Joe Biden stated Wednesday that he delegated “everything” as commander in chief to Harris, including foreign policy and domestic policy. Those criticisms appear to be confirmed in polling. A near-majority (48 percent) of Americans believe Harris just says what she thinks people want to hear, while only 36 percent think she says what she believes, a recent Economist/YouGov poll found. For the majority of her vice presidency, Harris has been very unpopular. She held the lowest net negative rating (-17) for a vice president in U.S. history before Harris joined the race. Her approval rating was only 28 percent in January 2024, and it improved to only 32 percent in July, the month Biden stepped aside. Harris’s approval rating is now 48 percent, an increase of 16 points in just two months. WATCH — Lindsey Graham: Kamala Harris Policies Are “Batsh-t Crazy”: “What changed?” digital strategist Greg Price asked on X this week. “The media coverage.” “Nothing about Kamala Harris has changed,” he said. “The media machine has kicked into over drive and too many people in America still think the news is real.

    "title": "You Don’t Say! Boris Johnson Admits He’s ‘Not Sure’ Coronavirus Lockdowns Actually Worked",
    "author": "Kurt Zindulka",
    "content": "Former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has belatedly admitted that he is “not sure” if the draconian lockdown measures imposed on the nation by his government during the Chinese coronavirus were effective in stemming the tide of the illness. In an excerpt of his upcoming memoirs published in the Daily Mail, Mr Johnson appears to have admitted to being swept up in the panic of the Wuhan virus, sensationally revealing that he considered a literal invasion of The Netherlands to obtain covid vaccines being blocked by the EU, as well as admitting that he had growing doubts about the effectiveness of the lockdown regime he foisted upon the British people. The former prime minister, who was reportedly initially in favour of taking a libertarian approach to the virus before having personally experienced a serious bout of the illness, after which he instituted some of the strictest restrictions of any Western leader, including stay at home orders, bans on mixing of households, telling people to not have casual sex, the implementation of health passports domestically, to the monitoring and censoring of critics. Now, over four years after the first lockdowns were imposed, Mr Johnson has suggested that maybe the restrictions weren’t really needed after all. The ex-PM wrote: “It was only later that I started to look at the curves of the pandemic around the world – the double hump that seemed to rise and fall irrespective of the approaches taken by governments. There were always two waves, whether you were in China, where lockdowns were ruthlessly enforced, or in Sweden, where they took a more voluntary approach. Looking back, I wonder if King Cnut was right all along when he stationed his throne on the shore of the Thames and asked his courtiers to watch as he vainly ordered the tide to withdraw. Maybe there are limits to human agency; maybe it isn’t possible for government action to repel the waves of a highly contagious disease, any more than it is possible to repel the tide of the Thames. I am not saying that lockdowns achieved nothing; I am sure they had some effect. But were they decisive in beating back the ­disease, turning that wave down? All I can say is that I am no longer sure.” The admission from Johnson comes after England Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty — one of the chief architects of lockdown restrictions in Britain — acknowledged earlier this week that Downing Street potentially “overdid” its response to the Chinese virus. Speaking at the Covid inquiry, Whitty admitted: “I was worried at the beginning. I still worry, actually in retrospect, about whether we got the level of concern right.” “Were we either over pitching it so that people were incredibly afraid of something where in fact, their actuarial risk was low, or we were not pitching it enough and therefore people didn’t realise the risk they were walking into. “I think that balance is really hard, and arguably, some people would say we, if anything we overdid it, rather than under [at] the beginning.” According to calculations last year from the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR), the lockdowns resulted in at least £118 billion in lost GDP for the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, the House of Commons Library estimated that the taxpayer funded between £310 and 410 billion in lockdown-related government expenses. A study published last year by the Institute for Economic Affairs found that countries with strict lockdown measures faired little better than those which took a laissez-faire stance towards the respiratory virus, such as Sweden, which broadly trusted the public to make their own health decisions. According to the study, which conducted a meta-analysis of 19,646 studies of coronavirus responses globally, found that lockdown measures only served to reduce mortality by 3.2 per cent during the initial wave of the virus. The authors of the study said: “The science of lockdowns is clear; the data are in: the deaths saved were a drop in the bucket compared to the staggering collateral costs imposed.”",

    "title": "Nolte: Lady ‘Ghostbusters’ Director Still Blames ‘Trump Supporters’ for Flop",
    "author": "John Nolte",
    "content": "Paul Feig, the director and co-writer of the all-female Ghostbusters (2016), is still blaming Trump supporters for that spectacular flop. Good grief, this guy has had eight years to do a little introspection about just how bad that movie was and how the marketing seemed determined to alienate the core fans. But, no, he’s still blaming us… “The political climate of the time was really weird, with Hillary Clinton running for office in 2016. There were a lot of dudes looking for a fight,” the little crybaby told the Guardian. “When I was getting piled on, on Twitter, I’d go back and see who they were. So many were Trump supporters.” “Then Trump came out against us. He was like: ‘They’re remaking Indiana Jones without Harrison Ford. You can’t do that. And now they’re making Ghostbusters with only women. What’s going on?’ and got all upset.” That’s true. Trump said that. And it was hilarious. Then Feig claims, “Everybody went fucking cannibal. It turned the movie into a political statement, as if to say: ‘If you’re pro-women, you’re going to go see this. If you’re not, then …’” “I didn’t think it mattered at all that the main characters were women,” he said, “but people brought a lot of baggage.” Let’s just go to the science, shall we? Point one: If the box office failure of Lady Ghostbusters was caused by American sexism towards all-female reboots, why was Ocean’s 8 a hit about 18 months later? Point two: How did Trump fans create this failure when Hillary Clinton won almost 66 million votes? You don’t even need 25 million of those voters, fewer than half, to find yourself with a box office hit. Roughly speaking, about 15 million people paid to see Lady Ghostbusters here in North America. Assuming all 15 million of those admissions were purchased by Hillary voters, that leaves 51 million Hillary voters who didn’t bother to see the movie. So… How is it the fault of us MAGA Bros. that 51 million Hillary Clinton voters didn’t want to see an all-female remake of Ghostbusters? Point three: Lady Ghostbusters opened pretty well with $46 million. This means that what killed it was… Point four: The movie was just bad — sexless, uninspired, choppy, not a single memorable scene or character, and no big laughs. Point five: Let’s not forget that the people involved in the movie chose to capitalize and lean into the online anger, rather than ignore it. Instead of rising above it to say this is a movie for everyone, the filmmakers sought to further divide the fans under the stupid belief they could score at the box office by turning out Hillary’s supporters.  How dumb was this? And this? And this? Point six: Trump supporters have the power to kill a Hollywood project? Yeah, I wish… All that aside, if the movie had been any good, it wouldn’t have lost tens of millions. John Nolte’s first and last novel, Borrowed Time, is winning five-star raves from everyday readers. You can read an excerpt here and an in-depth review here. Also available in hardcover and on Kindle and Audiobook.",

    "author": "Alana Mastrangelo",
    "content": "The cause of death for rapper Chino XL, who died suddenly on July 28 at the age of 50, was revealed on Friday. The family of Chino XL, whose real name was Derek Keith Barbosa, revealed that the rapper died by suicide, while the Ventura County Medical Examiner’s office lists his official cause of death as asphyxia as a result of ligature hanging, according to a report by TMZ. “With the most profound sadness imaginable, we share the news that our beloved father decided to end his own Life,” the family wrote. “It’s been the most painful and personal experience of our lives but in honor of Suicide Awareness Month, we decided to share this truth.” “Dad would hope that this news may help someone else stay alive,” Chino XL’s family added. The “No Complex” rapper reportedly battled lifelong depression and had been diagnosed with congenital heart failure in 2020. These details appeared to be unknown to his fans, as the rapper does not appear to have ever discussed the issues publicly. Chino XL’s daughters, Chynna, Bella, Lyric, and Kiyana, also said in a statement, “Our father was our rock and our best friend. Papa Bear loved us and taught us so much.” “Hundreds of emails, texts, chats and beautiful posts and comments on social media, have shown us that Dad was a fountain of strength to so many,” they continued. “He encouraged and comforted pretty much everyone in his path and left this dimension with an untouchable creative legacy.” “We are grateful beyond words for our time with Dad and are overwhelmed by the immeasurable global outpouring of love from around the world,” Chino XL’s daughter’s added. “We will forever navigate this catastrophic loss and ask for continued privacy.” Fans now await the rapper’s upcoming posthumous album, scheduled for release next month.

    "title": "‘Sopranos’ Star Drea de Matteo Calls Pro-Kamala Harris Celebrities ‘Meaningless’: ‘Hollywood Is Dead, The Music Industry Is Dead’",
    "author": "Alana Mastrangelo",
    "content": "Drea de Matteo, who played Adriana La Cerva on HBO’s The Sopranos, told Fox Business “Hollywood is dead. The music industry is dead,” and questioned the “integrity” of celebrities publicly claiming they support Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. “I’m still a super liberal, so I feel like it’s time for us all to come together, but a lot of people on the left are afraid,” de Matteo told Fox Business. “George Clooney, Meryl Streep, all of these huge celebrities endorsing war, supporting Dick Cheney.” “I don’t understand the inversion and how people have flipped, unless they’re under the gun, so to speak,” the actress added. “I find it hard to believe that people like George Clooney or Meryl Streep don’t actually know what’s going on.” de Matteo went on to call Hollywood “meaningless” with regards to the upcoming election, pointing out that anti-war and anti-establishment art — which once thrived in times like these — is now “dead.” “I think that Hollywood is meaningless in all of this,” she said. “I think the American dream is on hold. I feel like Hollywood is dead. The music industry is dead.” “There’s no cultural, artistic movements speaking out about this,” de Matteo added. “You don’t see fine art — there’s usually protest art about wars and censorship. And we’re stagnant right now.” Watch the latest video at foxbusiness.com The Sons of Anarchy actress also said she finds it “interesting to see these celebrities that are endorsing a situation that is the antithesis of what they once stood for as celebrities — of freedom of everything — speech, art, integrity.” “I question their integrity right now,” de Matteo said. The actress also noted that she and her cohort of “hippies” are bizarrely being referred to as “white nationalists,” simply “for supporting freedom.” “I find that so interesting, that that’s the culture we’re living in right now,” she said. “We’re hippies for humanity, and it’s like, where did the hippies go? I don’t understand where everybody disappeared to.” “We’re trying to bridge the gap between left and right,” de Matteo added. “I’m a liberal, and I can sit here with conservatives all day.” Earlier this month, de Matteo told Fox News that she backs Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s full-throated endorsement of former President Donald Trump. “At the very moment, all I care about is fighting for this country and just trying to wake up a few more of my fellow liberals to get back to the center of things and recognize that the things they always fought for — all of that weaponization on the left — is camouflage. They’re fighting for social issues that really don’t matter when you look at the big picture of what’s really happening behind the scenes,” she said. Over the summer, the actress commented on Hollywood’s reaction to the first (July 13) assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, saying that the political left does not exhibit “one undertone of peace,” despite claiming to be the Party of “inclusivity, love, and peace.” Before that, de Matteo said that Hollywood is full of “quiet” Trump supporters, and questioned how much actors are getting paid to publicly support the 45th president’s opponent ahead of this year’s election.

    "author": "Pam Key",
    "content": "Biden administration national Security spokesman John Kirby said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” that Israel’s military action that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and other top officials was “good for the world.” Kirby said, “I don’t think anybody is mourning the loss of Mr. Nasrallah, a known terrorist, a guy with American blood on his hands as well as Israeli blood on his hands. This is a terrorist organization. He was the leader of it. And I think people are safer without him walking around. But they’ll try to recover. We’re watching to see what they do to try to fill this leadership vacuum. It’s going to be tough that much of their command structure has now been wiped out.” Host Jake Tapper said, “Before President Obama gave the order for Seal Team Six to go in and take out Bin Laden, there was talk of an airstrike against the compound and the decision to not do so because they weren’t sure about the intelligence and because they were worried about, Obama was worried about civilian casualties. The Israelis wanted a different direction. Obviously, their intelligence was solid, but do you think Israel made the right decision doing it the way they did it? ” Kirby said, “I think having decimated the command structure of Hezbollah certainly works to the Israeli’s advantage. It’s actually good for the region, good for the world.” He added, “The president continues to believe that there needs to be time and space for diplomacy, and that means we’d like to see a ceasefire in place so that, that diplomacy can breathe.” Follow Pam Key on X @pamkeyNEN",

    "author": "Simon Kent",
    "content": "U.S. Navy warships shot down a barrage of Houthi terrorist cruise missiles and drones launched Friday from Yemen at the shipping lanes of the Red Sea. The Pentagon confirmed the attack and the successful response on Friday. “We did see a complex attack launched from the Houthis that ranged from cruise missiles and [unmanned aerial vehicles],” said Sabrina Singh, deputy press secretary for the Defense Department.\nStars and Stripes reports the Iran-backed Houthi claimed to have damaged three U.S. Navy warships in a concentrated bombardment of 23 missiles and bomber drones. The destroyers, the Houthis’ military spokesperson claimed in a televised speech, were targeted as they transited the Bab al-Mandeb Strait in the Red Sea. He said the attack was carried out as the U.S. destroyers were “on their way to support the Israeli enemy.” RELATED: U.S. Forces Strikes Houthi Targets in Red Sea Show of Defense The Bab al-Mandeb Strait connects the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden, between Yemen. “My understanding is that those were either engaged and shot down or failed,” Singh said, referring to the Houthi missiles and drones. No U.S. military ships were struck, and there were no injuries to U.S. service members, she also said as she dismissed the claims outright. The USS Abraham Lincoln and its carrier strike group are in the region. The strike group includes three destroyers: USS Spruance, USS Stockdale, and USS O’Kane. Singh on Friday declined to say whether the destroyers were the intended targets of the Houthi missiles. “We did what we had to do to protect our forces, and at the end of the day, no ship was hit — no damage and no injuries to our personnel,” she said. The Houthis have been targeting cargo ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since Oct. 7 last year when Hamas terrorists attacked Israel. Earlier this year, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced a multinational mission, Operation Prosperity Guardian, to counter Houthi attacks.",

    "author": "Dylan Gwinn",
    "content": "17-year-old Alabama superstar wide receiver Ryan Williams has a very bright future and career ahead of him, but it’s probably not as a Hallmark greeting card writer. Williams caught six passes for 177 yards and the game-winning 75-yard touchdown, on their way to an incredible 41-34 victory over Georgia. However, one of Williams’ most attention-grabbing moments wasn’t when he was juggling and catching a 54-yard bomb or scoring a TD. It was during a timeout when cameras caught a shot of his eye tape, which read, “KILL EVERYBODY.” Did Williams actually kill anyone last night? No. Did he break some ankles and make catches a 17-year-old has no business making? Oh, yeah. In all likelihood, the win means that Alabama will be the #2 team in the country (maybe #1) when the rankings come out. Georgia may lose ground, but not that much, thanks to overcoming a 26-point deficit to retake the lead, a lead that would have stood had it not been for the theatrics of a guy with “KILL EVERYBODY” on his face. Georgia has Auburn at home next week. Alabama has Vanderbilt on the road.",

    "author": "Amy Furr",
    "content": "A pregnant mother told CNN she is “completely trapped” inside her home in Tater Hill, North Carolina, due to flooding from Hurricane Helene. The mother of two, Jennifer Replogle, spoke with the outlet Saturday morning. She said the roads are gone, there is no power, no food, and water is running out. “Our basement flooded yesterday. If they don’t get somebody to us soon, I really don’t know what to do,” Replogle explained. Aerial video footage shows the massive flooding in North Carolina with roads severely damaged and homes left looking like piles of debris: The hurricane brought strong winds and heavy rains to North Carolina on Thursday evening after it made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane in Florida where it left massive destruction in its wake, the Asheville Citizen Times reported Sunday. “The storm left more than 1 million customers without power across North Carolina immediately following the storm, including more than 440,000 in Western North Carolina,” the outlet said. At least 64 people have died due to the storm and cleanup efforts have begun as millions are still without power, the Associated Press (AP) reported Sunday. “Among the dead are three firefighters, a mother and her 1-month-old twins and an 89-year-old woman who was struck by a tree that hit her house,” according to a New York Post article published Saturday. After the storm hit Florida, it eventually moved into Georgia where Gov. Brian Kemp (R) said the area “looks like a bomb went off” after he viewed the devastation it left behind, the AP article said. Meanwhile, the Weather Channel reported: O​n Sunday morning, North Carolina’s Governor announced that President Joe Biden approved his request for a Federal Major Disaster Declaration, providing immediate federal help for the western North Carolina region. This declaration is in addition to the federal emergency declaration that was in place before Tropical Storm Helene hit the state. As Helene barged inland, western North Carolina faced devastating flooding with some areas submerged under feet of water. Other neighborhoods were isolated by standing water or mudslides. “Over 400 roads remain closed in North Carolina,” The North Carolina Department of Transportation said Saturday. “All roads in Western NC should be considered closed.” While speaking with CNN, Replogle told the outlet, “We weren’t prepared for this.”",

Second of all, Vice President Kamala Harris has not mentally impaired.” Graham said, “I just think she’s crazy, liberal.” Tapper said, “But what do you think about that rhetoric?” Graham said, “I just think the better course to take has to prosecute the case case that her policies are destroying the country.

That is anything but respect for the rule of law. So I know that a lot of Conservative Republicans feel the way I do, that you just can’t support a candidate like that.” He added, “With regard to tariffs as well, there are reasons to impose tariffs, but to pretend that we’re going to get a wind windfall of money from some foreign government because we’re imposing tariffs just doesn’t jive with what and where conservatives have been on free trade.” Flake concluded, “Vice President Harris can win Arizona, and I  think she’s gaining here.

    "title": "IDF Targets Remnants of Hezbollah Leadership; 20 Killed Alongside Nasrallah",
    "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
    "content": "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) carried out airstrikes on Sunday targeting Hezbollah’s remaining officials, following the killing of leader Hassan Nasrallah on Friday, whom Israel said was killed with 20 other terrorist commanders. In a statement Sunday, the IDF said: This past Friday, in a precise airstrike carried out by the Israeli Air Force, directed by the Intelligence Directorate, fighter jets struck and eliminated Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Hezbollah terrorist organization, and Ali Karaki, the Commander of Hezbollah’s Southern Front, who was one of the remaining senior commanders in the organization before the strike. More than 20 other terrorists of varying ranks, who were present at the underground headquarters in Beirut located beneath civilian buildings, and were managing Hezbollah’s terrorist operations against the State of Israel, were also eliminated. Among the terrorists eliminated:\n* Ibrahim Hussein Jazini – Head of Nasrallah’s Security Unit.\n* Samir Tawfiq Dib – Nasrallah’s long-time confidant and advisor on terrorist activities.\n* Abed al-Amir Muhammad Sablini – Head of Hezbollah’s Force-Build Up.\n* Ali Naaf Ayoub – responsible for coordinating Hezbollah’s firepower. Ibrahim Hussein Jazini and Samir Tawfiq Dib were among Nasrallah’s closest associates. Due to their proximity to him, they served a significant role in the day-to-day operations of Hezbollah and Nasrallah in particular. The terrorists were located at Hezbollah’s central headquarters in the heart of Beirut, embedded beneath several civilian buildings and near UN schools. In a separate statement, the IDF announced that it had killed Nabil Qaouk, “the Commander of Hezbollah’s Preventative Security Unit, and member of the terrorist organization’s Central Council.” There was an unconfirmed report Sunday that Israel had also targeted Abu Ali Rada, the last member of Hezbollah’s leadership depicted on a now-famous organogram showing the hierarchy of the organization’s major officials. Israel also targeted Hezbollah weapons caches and rocket launchers. At the same time, the IDF continued targeting Hamas targets in Gaza, including a “command-and-control” center inside a former school. “This is a further example of the Hamas terrorist organization’s systematic abuse of civilian infrastructure in violation of international law,” the IDF noted in a statement. U.S. President Joe Biden renewed his call for a ceasefire, both in Lebanon and Gaza, on Saturday evening. Joel B.

    "title": "Newsom Signs Law Reversing Policy Kamala Used to Punish Parents of Truant Children",
    "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
    "content": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) signed a law Thursday to reverse a policy that Kamala Harris championed to threaten the parents of truant schoolchildren when she was District Attorney of San Francisco and California Attorney General. As Breitbart News has noted: Kamala Harris prosecuted the parents of truant children as District Attorney of San Francisco and California Attorney General in a dubious effort to improve attendance that disproportionately hurt people of color in her state. Harris tried to walk back her support for prosecuting truancy when she last ran for president in 2019. She even falsely claimed that no one had been jailed as a result of her policy, when in fact parents had been prosecuted and jailed. As former Breitbart News White House correspondent Charlie Spiering wrote in his book on Harris, Amateur Hour: Kamala Harris in the White House, Harris was lenient toward cop killers, murderers, and gun offenders, and botched a thousand drug cases tainted by faulty evidence, but she was tough on parents of truant children. She even “made a public show of using her authority to strike fear into the hearts of public-school-attending families,” Spiering recalled. The issue came up in 2019, when National Public Radio noted that Harris’s program hurt black and Latino parents. Newsom signed SB 691, which notes: Existing law requires a school district, upon a pupil’s initial classification as a truant, to notify the pupil’s parent or guardian of specified information, including, among other information, that the pupil and parent or guardian of the pupil may be subject to prosecution, as specified, and that it is recommended that the parent or guardian accompany the pupil to school and attend classes with the pupil for one day. This bill, commencing July 1, 2025, would remove those specific pieces of information from that notification and would require that notification to include additional information, including, among other information, that mental health and supportive services may be available to the pupil and the family and that school personnel are available to meet with the pupil and family to develop strategies to support the pupil’s attendance at school. The San Francisco Chronicle noted: As San Francisco district attorney, Harris prosecuted some parents as part of her efforts to reduce truancy. … As attorney general, she championed a proposal that Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed into law in 2010 that allowed parents of chronically truant students to be charged with misdemeanors and sentenced to up to a year in jail. Harris later expressed regret for the policy. She — and the Chronicle — say she was not personally responsible for jailing parents, even though that was clearly the letter of the law that she promoted and enthusiastically implemented. Joel B.

    "content": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) – More than 100 Ukrainian drones were shot down over Russia Sunday, officials said, sparking a wildfire and setting an apartment block alight in one of the largest barrages seen over Russian skies since Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Russia´s Ministry of Defense reported that it had shot down 125 drones overnight across seven regions. The southwestern region of Volgograd came under particularly heavy fire, with 67 Ukrainian drones reportedly downed by Russian air defenses. Seventeen drones were also seen over Russia’s Voronezh region, where falling debris damaged an apartment block and a private home, said local governor Aleksandr Gusev. Images on social media showed flames rising from the windows of the top floor of a high-rise building. No casualties were reported. A further 18 drones were reported over Russia’s Rostov region, where falling debris sparked a wildfire, said Gov. Vasily Golubev. He said that the fire did not pose a threat to populated areas, but that emergency services were fighting to extinguish the blaze, which had engulfed 20 hectares (49.4 acres) of forest. Meanwhile, 13 civilians were injured in an overnight barrage on the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia Sunday after Ukrainian military leaders warned that Moscow could be preparing for a new military offensive in the country´s south. The city was targeted by Russian guide bombs in 10 separate attacks that damaged a high-rise building and several residential homes, regional governor Ivan Fedorov wrote on his official Telegram channel. More people could still be trapped beneath the rubble, he said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also said that the Zaporizhzhia attack had damaged the city’s transport links. “Today, Russia struck Zaporizhzhia with aerial bombs. Ordinary residential buildings were damaged and the entrance of one building was destroyed. The city’s infrastructure and railway were also damaged,” Zelenskyy said in a post on X, formerly Twitter. “In total, 13 people were injured, and two were rescued from under the rubble. I thank all the emergency services for their rapid response and providing necessary assistance. The rubble clearing is still ongoing.” The attacks come after the Ukrainian military warned Saturday that Russian forces may be preparing for offensive operations in the wider Zaporizhzhia region. Vladyslav Voloshyn, spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern military command, said that Russia was amassing personnel in this direction. Ukraine’s air force also reported that 22 Russian drones were launched over the country overnight. It said that 15 were shot down in Ukraine’s Sumy, Vinnytsia, Mykolaiv, and Odesa regions, and that five more were destroyed using electronic defenses. The fate of the remaining two drones was not specified.",

    "title": "‘SNL’ Jokes About Deadly Trump Assassination Attempt: ‘Disgusting’",
    "author": "Simon Kent",
    "content": "NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” saw much humor to be had in the two recent assassination attempts against former President Donald Trump as it launched its 50th season. The Trump War Room was quick to point out the macabre lack of taste the segment displayed. Taking to X, it posted its displeasure, summing it up in the one word, “disgusting.” “There were two assassination attempts against President Trump within a span of seven weeks.@nbcsnl apparently finds that funny. Disgusting.” The segment in question features Trump, as played by actor James Austin Johnson, addressing his Republican followers, urging them to “come on back because we’re having fun.” He then goes on to say “we love my rallies, except when somebody goes bing bing bing bong bing right at me… you know that happened because of the rhetoric of the radical left.” “Saturday Night Live” began its 50th season with a parade of former co-stars, including Maya Rudolph as Vice President Kamala Harris, Andy Samberg as her husband Doug Emhoff and Dana Carvey as President Joe Biden, as Breitbart News reported. “We’ve got to stay focused,” Rudolph-as-Harris said at a mock rally in the show’s cold open. “If we win, together, we can end the drama-la and the trauma-la and go relax in our pajama-las.”",

    "title": "Joe Biden Skewered in ‘SNL’ Season 50 Return: ‘A Lot of People Forget I’m President, Including Me’",
    "author": "Breitbart News",
    "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — “Saturday Night Live” began its 50th season with a parade of former co-stars, including Maya Rudolph as Vice President Kamala Harris, Andy Samberg as her husband Doug Emhoff and Dana Carvey as President Joe Biden. “We’ve got to stay focused,” Rudolph-as-Harris said at a mock rally in the show’s cold open. “If we win, together, we can end the drama-la and the trauma-la and go relax in our pajama-las.” After bringing out running mate Tim Walz, played by comedian and actor Jim Gaffigan, she invited Samberg-as Emhoff to the stage and then, almost as an afterthought, Biden, played by the oldest of the group, the 69-year-old Carvey. “A lot of people forget I’m president, including me,” said Carvey, best known on the show for playing President George W. Bush in the late 1980s. Rudolph and Carvey jointly delivered the “Live from New York, it’s Saturday night” that launched season 50 of the sketch comedy institution. Rudolph’s return to play Harris — she won an Emmy for playing her previously — had been reported, but it was not certain when she would appear. The guest spots from Carvey, Samberg and Gaffigan were all surprises. “Designing Women” star Jean Smart, fresh off winning her sixth Emmy for her lead role in “Hacks,” was host, a role the 73-year-old has somehow never played in a four-decade career. “I remember watching the first episode of ‘SNL’ and thinking, ’someday I’m going to host that show,” Smart said in her opening monologue. “And this is the first Saturday that fit my schedule.” That first episode came on Oct. 11, 1975, with Lorne Michaels at the helm, just as he is now. George Carlin hosted and the nation got its first dose of the Not Ready for Prime Time Players: Chevy Chase, John Belushi, Gilda Radner, Dan Akroyd, Jane Curtin, Laraine Newman and Garrett Morris. There were two musical guests — Billy Preston and Janis Ian — playing two songs apiece, the norm in the early days. The country singer and rapper Jelly Roll had the music role to himself Saturday, singing his songs “Liar” and “Sober.” Like Smart, he was a first-timer. Smart introduced Jelly Roll with her “Hacks” co-star Hannah Einbinder, the daughter of original cast member Newman. That debut show is documented and reenacted in the newly released Jason Reitman film “Saturday Night,” part of a wave of reflection and celebration the show is getting on the cusp of its 50th anniversary. Despite the showy guest stars on this Saturday night, regular cast members took on the bulk of the show, which quickly settled into its regular routine. James Austin Johnson was back playing Donald Trump at his own rally, saying he wanted Biden as an opponent instead of Harris. “We miss Joe Biden, folks,” Johnson’s Trump said. “What we wouldn’t give to have him stand next to me and be old.” Colin Jost and Michael Che returned for another season of the mock-news “Weekend Update.” “There were so many insane political stories this summer and everyone kept asking, ‘Are you are you so bummed you aren’t on the air right now?” Jost said to open the segment. “And I was like, ’I have a feeling there’s going to be more that happens when we get back.’” Rudolph, Carvey, Gaffigan and Samberg joined Smart, Jelly Roll and the cast on stage for the traditional sign-off. Upcoming episodes are scheduled to feature host Nate Bargatze with musical guest Coldplay, Ariana Grande with Stevie Nicks, Michael Keaton with Billie Eilish and John Mulaney with Chappell Roan. Those shows will lead up to a three-hour primetime special on Feb. 16 that will serve as the official 50th season celebration. It’s sure to feature a wide range of the many stars the show has spawned, including Bill Murray, Eddie Murphy, Billy Crystal, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Robert Downey Jr., Mike Myers, Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, Tina Fey, Amy Poehler and Will Ferrell.",

    "title": "Syrian Migrant Arrested as Alleged Arson Rampage Leaves over 30 Injured in Germany",
    "author": "Kurt Zindulka",
    "content": "A 41-year-old Syrian man has been arrested in Essen, Germany after allegedly ramming a van into storefronts Saturday and setting two fires that injured over 30 people, including two small children. The suspected migrant attacker is due to appear before a judge on Sunday facing charges of aggravated arson and attempted murder. The Syrian national is accused of driving a van into two stores and starting two fires, which left two children in critical condition due to smoke inhalation and dozens more injured as exits were blocked off, broadcaster NTV reports. While local residents attempted to mount a rescue effort of their own, their ladders were not tall enough to reach the windows of the buildings set ablaze, forcing those inside to hang outside of the windows to breathe. Firefighters, who were forced to confront two fires simultaneously, were fortunately able to save all those inside before any fatalities occurred. Around 160 emergency personnel were involved in the rescue operation, which took around an hour and a half. After allegedly setting the fires, the migrant is reported to have threatened to stab people with a long blade, before being surrounded by several men clad with shovels and poles, who subdued and detained him until police could arrive. Essen Mayor Thomas Kufen expressed his gratitude to the fire brigade, police, and rescue workers, saying: “I would like to thank everyone who calmly helped to bring the alleged perpetrator to task for their moral courage.” Authorities were quick to deny any terrorist motivation behind the attack, with Welt reporting that security service sources believe the attack was rather motivated by a familial conflict. Local police said that initial investigations point to the man becoming enraged over his wife leaving him. “The acts were obviously aimed specifically at a family,” said Mayor Kufen. According to the German paper, twelve people were injured in the first fire and a further 19 were injured in the second, with all injuries being caused by smoke inhalation. Welt reported that two children suffered life-threatening injuries from the smoke, which is particularly dangerous for developing lungs. The two children are believed to be two and four years-old. In total, eight children were hospitalised as a result of the fires. The suspected attack comes amid a broader debated about immigration in Germany, with the government enacting emergency border controls and seeking to embark upon deportations to Afghanistan and Syria in the wake of deadly terror attacks by migrants in Mannheim and Solingen earlier this year.",

    "author": "Breitbart London",
    "content": "MADRID (AP) – Nine people have died and another 48 are missing after a boat carrying migrants capsized during a rescue operation near the Canary Islands, Spanish authorities said Saturday. Spain’s maritime rescue service said that the tragedy occurred after it was alerted to the presence of a small boat loaded with people some 6 1/2 kilometers (4 miles) from the island of El Hierro. The boat turned over when too many people moved to one side during the rescue attempt, according to a statement by the rescue service. Rescuers have saved 27 people and confirmed nine dead. The service said that the scue operation was made more difficult because it was carried out during the night and under gusts of winds that reached 20 knots. Rescue craft and helicopters of the maritime rescue service, the Civil Guard, the Red Cross and the local government all participated in the operation. The Atlantic route for migrants from West Africa to the Canary Islands is one of the deadliest in the world. While there is no accurate death toll because of the lack of information on departures from West Africa, Spanish migrant rights group Walking Borders estimates the victims are in the thousands. Over 26,000 people have arrived via sea to the Canary Islands so far this year, compared to some 14,000 in the same period last year. Located nearer to Africa than mainland Spain, the archipelago seen by most as a step toward continental Europe. Many come from Mali as well as youth from Senegal, Mauritania and other West African countries seeking better job opportunities abroad or fleeing violence and political instability.",

    "title": "Leading Labour MP Quits Party over ‘Off the Scale’ Sleaze Shown by Starmer During Donations Scandal",
    "author": "Kurt Zindulka",
    "content": "A prominent Labour MP has quit the left-wing party amid the growing gifts scandal surrounding Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and top members of his government, declaring that the “sleaze, nepotism and apparent avarice are off the scale.” Canterbury Member of Parliament Rosie Duffield announced Saturday evening that she will leave Labour to become an independent lawmaker, accusing the prime minister of failing to uphold left-wing principles, using “heavy-handed management tactics” to quell dissent among the backbench, and displaying a lack of “political instincts” in the handling of the so-called freebies scandal. Not even three months in office, Starmer’s government has seen widespread pushback, including over allegations of “two-tier” policing during the anti-mass migration protests and riots, for cutting winter fuel subsidies to pensioners amid energy and economic struggles, and most recently, for accepting hundreds of thousands in “gifts” from Labour donors in the form of designer clothes, glasses, tickets for concerts and football matches, among others. Prime Minister Starmer has admitted taking over £100,000 in “freebies”, including over £30,000 from millionaire media mogul and Labour Party life peer Lord Alli, who was granted special access to Downing Street despite not having a role in the new government. Starmer and other members of his government have attempted to brush off the budding scandal while claiming that to personal donations were all above board. However, in her resignation letter, provided to The Times, Duffield said that the “revelations of hypocrisy have been staggering and increasingly outrageous,” adding: “I cannot put into words how angry I and my colleagues are at your total lack of understanding about how you have made us all appear.” “How dare you take our longed-for victory, the electorate’s sacred and precious trust, and throw it back in their individual faces and the faces of dedicated and hardworking Labour MPs?! The sleaze, nepotism and apparent avarice are off the scale,” she declared. “I now have no confidence in your commitment to deliver the so-called ‘change’ you promised during the General Election campaign and the changes we have been striving for as a political party for over a decade,” the MP said. Duffield, who has previously clashed with Labour leadership over issues such as the transgender encroachment on female rights, said that she is “ashamed” of Starmer and his inner circle, saying that accepting “expensive personal gifts of designer suits and glasses costing more than most of those people can grasp” was contrary to what she believes should be the principles of the left-wing Labour Party. The Canterbury MP continued: “As Prime Minister, your managerial and technocratic approach, and lack of basic politics and political instincts, have come crashing down on us as a party after we worked so hard, promised so much, and waited a long fourteen years to be mandated by the British public to return to power. Since the change of government in July, the revelations of hypocrisy have been staggering and increasingly outrageous.” Demonstrating the lack of political instincts from Starmer, she noted that he leapfrogged from his post as head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) over more experienced politicians within the party to the top ranks and ultimately to become leader in relatively short order. Meanwhile, she accused the PM of elevating people “who happen to be related to those close to you, or even each other” despite having “no proven political skills,” which she described as “frankly embarrassing.” The lack of political awareness within the government, Duffield argued, manifested in Starmer refusing to show “even the slightest bit of embarrassment or remorse” about accepting lavish personal donations, while simultaneously cutting winter fuel aid to pensioners and refusing to lift the Tory two-child credit limit. “You repeat often that you will make the ‘tough decisions’ and that the country is ‘all in this together’. But those decisions do not directly affect any one of us in Parliament,” she wrote. “They are cruel and unnecessary, and affect hundreds of thousands of our poorest, most vulnerable constituents.”",

    "title": "Reports: Israel Sends Small Commando Missions into Lebanon",
    "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
    "content": "Israel Defense Forces (IDF) commandos have begun carrying out small incursions into southern Lebanon to destroy Hezbollah positions, ahead of a possible ground invasion, taking advantage of disarray in the terrorist organization. ABC News reported Saturday night: Small-scale operations or “border movements” into Lebanon to take out Hezbollah positions right on the border have begun or are about to, according to two U.S. officials. Israel does not yet appear to have fully decided whether to launch a ground operation but is prepared for one, the officials said. If a ground operation happens, its scope will likely be limited, sources said. The key is fulfilling the promise to Israelis that the tens of thousands displaced from northern Israel will be able to go home. To do that, decapitating Hezbollah is not enough, the officials said. The New York Times reported that Israel has been infiltrating Lebanon for a long time for intelligence operations: Israel has used Lebanon’s proximity to its advantage — Jerusalem is less than 150 miles from the Lebanese border — to insert undercover commandos deep into the country to conduct sensitive intelligence missions. Most important, former U.S. and Israeli officials say that Israel’s audacity to carry out such operations set it apart from traditional intelligence agencies with less of an appetite for risk and legal hurdles. Hezbollah and other Iranian terrorist proxies have struggled to respond to Israel’s attacks over the last two weeks, beginning with the pager attacks widely attributed to Israel, and culminating in the killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah on Friday night. Houthi rebels fired a third ballistic missile at Israel on Saturday, which was downed. Other rockets and missiles were fired from Lebanon, and were either intercepted or landed without causing damage. Shiite militias in Iraq, which are also controlled by Iran, fired a drone toward the southern Israeli port city of Eilat. Israel’s objective in a ground mission would be to push Hezbollah out of southern Lebanon, north of the Litani River, in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 of 2006. U.S. President Joe Biden does not back such a mission, reiterating his call for a ceasefire on Saturday evening, in the face of Israel’s ongoing military success. Joel B.

    "content": "President Joe Biden called for a ceasefire in Lebanon again on Saturday evening, hours after the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was confirmed, and Israel continued pounding Hezbollah leaders and weapons caches. As Breitbart News noted, Israel killed Nasrallah on Friday evening in an airstrike on Hezbollah’s underground headquarters in Beirut, Lebanon. Iran, Hezbollah’s patron, initially denied his death, but Hezbollah confirmed it. Biden released a statement on Saturday welcoming Nasrallah’s death, but reiterating his call for a ceasefire deal, both in Lebanon and Gaza. He did so again in response to shouted questions from reporters on Saturday. Former White House adviser Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of President Donald Trump, posted a lengthy response to Nasrallah’s death on Saturday evening, saying that a ceasefire would be “irresponsible,” and that Israel should destroy the remnants of Hezbollah so that Iran could no longer threaten the Middle East with war. “The right move now for America would be to tell Israel to finish the job. It’s long overdue. And it’s not only Israel’s fight,” Kushner wrote. Joel B.

    "title": "Jared Kushner on Hezbollah: ‘Tell Israel to Finish the Job’",
    "author": "Elizabeth Weibel",
    "content": "Former President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner encouraged the United States on Saturday evening to “tell Israel to finish the job,” in the aftermath of the news that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in an airstrike. In a post on X, Kushner described September 27 as being “the most important day in the Middle East” since the Abraham Accords, an agreement bringing peace and diplomacy between two Arab states and Israel, under the Trump administration. Kushner added people calling for a ceasefire are “wrong,” noting that Israel “cannot afford now to not finish the job” they’ve started. The post from Kushner, who previously served as a White House adviser for Trump, came after the IDF confirmed on Saturday that Nasrallah was killed in an airstrike on Friday. “September 27th is the most important day in the Middle East since the Abraham Accords breakthrough,” Kushner wrote. “I have spent countless hours studying Hezbollah and there is not an expert on earth who thought that what Israel has done to decapitate and degrade them was possible.” “This is significant because Iran is now fully exposed,” Kushner added. “The reason why their nuclear facilities have not been destroyed despite weak air defense systems, is because Hezbollah has been a loaded gun pointed at Israel. Iran spent the last forty years building this capability at its deterrent.” Kushner pointed out that “Iranian leadership is stuck in the old Middle East,” while countries such as Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, and Kuwait in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) were “sprinting toward the future by investing in their populations and infrastructure.” Israel now finds itself with the threat from Gaza most neutralized and the opportunity to neutralize Hezbollah in the north. It’s unfortunate how we got here but maybe there can be a silver lining in the end. Anyone who has been calling for a ceasefire in the North is wrong. There is no going back for Israe. They cannot afford now to not finish the job and completely dismantle the arsenal that has been aimed at them. They will never get another chance. After the brilliant, rapid-fire tactical successes of the pagers, radios, and targeting of leadership, Hezbollah’s massive weapon cache is unguarded and unmanned. Most of Hezbollah fighters are hiding in their tunnels. Anyone still around was not important enough to carry a pager to be invited to a leadership meeting. Iran is reeling, as well, inesecure and unsure how deeply its own intelligence has been penetrated. Failing to take full advantage of this opportunity to neutralize the threat is irresponsible. Kushner added that after the killing of Nasrallah, and in the aftermath of “16 top commanders” being eliminated, he had “started thinking about a Middle East without Iran’s fully loaded arsenal aimed at Israel.” “The right move now for America would be to tell Israel to finish the job,” Kushner added. “It’s long overdue. And it’s not only Israel’s fight.” Kushner added that within the “past six weeks” Israel had killed “as many terrorists on the US list of wanted terrorists” than the U.S. government had killed “in the last 20 years.” “And now, over the past six weeks or so, Israel has eliminated as many terrorists on the US list of wanted terrorists as the US has done in the last 20 years,” Kushner wrote. “Including Ibrahim Aqil, the leader of Hezbollah’s Islamic Jihad Organization who masterminded the 1983 killing of those Marines.”",

    "content": "Former President Donald Trump received a loud welcome from the crowd attending the college football game between the University of Alabama and the University of Georgia. Trump’s guests included Kid Rock, Hank Williams Jr., John Daly, Sen. Tommy Tuberville, Sen. Steve Daines, and Sen. Katie Britt. The former president was recognized by the announcer. Video footage posted to X showed Trump waving while standing in a special box for the game, while the crowd from the student section could be heard cheering for him. In another video posted to X, as Trump arrived at Bryant-Denny Stadium at the University of Alabama, a crowd of people could be heard chanting, “USA! USA!” People could also be heard chanting, “Four more years!” as Trump interacted with the crowd. In another video, Trump also appeared on the jumbotron at Bryant-Denny Stadium during the game. The crowd could be heard chanting, “USA! USA!” and cheering loudly as Trump was shown on the jumbotron. The excitement surrounding Trump’s attendance at the Alabama-Georgia game comes in comparison to  the boos that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D), the vice presidential running mate of Vice President Kamala Harris, received from University of Michigan fans. In a video posted to TikTok, a crowd of people could be heard booing Walz, with one guy yelling, “Get that b***h out of here.”",

    "content": "Former President Donald Trump is leading Vice President Kamala Harris in five key swing states, according to a recent poll. A poll conducted by AtlasIntel between September 20-25, 2024, found that Trump was leading Harris among likely voters in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia, and Arizona. In Nevada and North Carolina, Harris was found to be leading Trump. In Pennsylvania, Trump received 51 percent of support among likely voters, while Harris received 48.1 percent of support. The poll found that in Wisconsin, Trump received 49.7 percent of support, while Harris received 48.2 percent of support. Among 918 likely voters surveyed in Michigan, Trump received 50.6 percent of support, while Harris received 47.2 percent of support. Out of 1,200 likely voters surveyed in Georgia, Trump showed a narrow lead with 49.6 percent of support, while Harris received 49 percent of support. In Arizona, Trump received 49.8 percent of support, while Harris received 48.6 percent of support among 946 likely voters surveyed. In states such as Nevada and North Carolina, Harris received 50.5 percent of support, while Trump received 47.7  percent of support in Nevada and 48.1 percent of support in North Carolina. A poll conducted by InsiderAdvantage and the Trafalgar Group in August found that Trump was leading Harris in key swing states such as Pennsylvania, Nevada, and North Carolina, and held a narrow lead in Arizona. In an interview with Breitbart News Washington bureau chief Matthew Boyle, Trump explained that his campaign was planning to ramp up its activity in the final days of the election by holding events in not just swing states, but in red and blue states as well.",

    "author": "Elizabeth Weibel",
    "content": "Sen. JD Vance (R-OH) was denied entry to a restaurant outside of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, that he described as being a “great local business.” In a post on X, NBC News reporter Gary Grumbach wrote that the press was told by a restaurant worker at the Primanti Bros. Restaurant and Sports Bar located in North Versailles that “cameras were not allowed,” adding that the restaurant “did not want a ‘campaign event.'” The restaurant chain, which has locations throughout Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Maryland, is known for its sandwiches. In another video posted to X, Vance was seen outside the restaurant talking to a crowd of people and telling them to “keep” supporting the restaurant, and encouraging them to vote in the upcoming presidential election. “We paid for everybody’s food, we gave them a nice tip,” Vance explained. “And, of course when I gave them a nice tip, I said, ‘No taxes on tips.” Don’t hold it against her, she just got a little nervous. But, it’s a great local business, let’s keep on supporting it, and most importantly, November 5th, or before, go vote. Let’s go win this thing.” Adam Golomb, the CEO of Primanti Bros. explained in a statement to TribLive, that the restaurant had reportedly not received “any advance notice,” which led to “momentary confusion.” “Without any advance notice, today’s campaign stop caused some momentary confusion for our staff,” Golomb said in a statement. “However, Senator Vance and his team were welcomed into our restaurant shortly after and engaged with our guests inside and on the property.” This comes after there were claims that customers at a Primanti Bros. location in Moon, Pennsylvania, were reportedly told to leave prior to Vice President Kamala Harris and her vice presidential running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D), arriving for a campaign event, according to Fox News.",

    "content": "More Americans identify as Republicans than Democrats at this point in the election season for the first time in decades, a Gallup poll reveals. Not only did 48 percent of respondents say they either identify as Republicans or are leaning Republican for the upcoming election — compared to just 45 percent who identified as Democrats — Gallup analysts also said that “nearly all” measures that have shown some relationship to past presidential election outcomes are favoring the GOP as well. “By 46 percent to 41 percent, Americans say the Republican Party is better able than the Democratic Party to address what they think is the most important problem facing the country,” Gallup’s Jeffrey M. Jones wrote. “The top issues Americans currently name as the most important are ones that tend to favor the GOP, including the economy (24 percent), immigration (22 percent), the government (17 percent) and inflation (15 percent).” The last time that even the same number of Americans identified as Republican and Democrat in the third quarter of an election year (July to September) was in 2004 — the year that former President George W. Bush won his second term. Even when only 43 percent of respondents identified with Republicans compared to the Democrats’ 46 percent in 2016, former President Donald Trump was still successful in his bid for office. A graph of the data shared by Republican political consultant Frank Luntz showed how Republicans have won in the past, even with an even or disadvantaged playing field according to Gallup’s third-quarter poll: “My heart. I love this so much,” wrote Republican voter registration activist Scott Presler: “If this is accurate the polls are REALLY underestimating Trump,” replied another X user. “You always see D+ 3 or 5 polls. You never see R+3 polls”:",

    "content": "The official union of the U.S. Border Patrol accused Vice President Kamala Harris of using her first border visit in over three years as a “photo op,” claiming that she just repeated the things that agents had already been saying. “Vice president Harris has ignored the border problem she created for over three years. She goes down there for 20 minutes for a photo op and decides to repeat some of the things the NPBC has said before. But again, where has she been the last 3 1/2 years?” the National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) wrote in an X post: NBPC vice president Art Del Cueto made similar claims on an appearance on Fox News, saying that Harris did not even speak to any agents when she visited the U.S.-Mexico border in Douglas, Arizona, on Friday: “President Trump actually cares and he’s actually gone down there and met with boots on the ground,” Del Cueto said. During her short appearance in Douglas, Harris slammed former President Donald Trump for not “fixing” the problem. Referring to the failed bipartisan border bill, the Democrat candidate claimed Trump “tanked it.” “It was the strongest border security bill we have seen in decades. It was endorsed by the Border Patrol union, and it should be in effect today, producing results in real time right now for our country,” she said during her speech. “But Donald Trump tanked it… because, you see, he prefers to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem.” “VP Harris asserted in Arizona that CBP needed more resources,” the NBPC said in another X post: “We have apprehended over 8 million illegal immigrants over the last 4 years and now you realize we need more help 38 days before the election.”",

    "title": "Exclusive–Vance Spokesman: Teamsters Rank-and-File Know Workers Were ‘Better Off’ Under Trump",
    "author": "Nick Gilbertson",
    "content": "Rank-and-file Teamsters know that “American workers were safer and better off” under former President Donald Trump’s administration, William Martin, a spokesman for Republican Vice Presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance (R-OH), told Breitbart News. Internal polling from the Teamsters shows that he is dominating the presidential race against Vice President Kamala Harris among the rank-and-file members. Nearly 60 percent of Teamsters sampled in a September 9-15 poll support Trump, while a mere 31 percent back Harris. Moreover, Trump leads Harris with Teamsters members in every single state. “It’s no wonder that rank-and-file Teamsters support President Trump – they simply reject Kamala Harris’s policies of crippling inflation, high gas and electricity prices, millions of illegal immigrants coming into our country, and fewer jobs for American workers,” Martin told Breitbart News in a statement. “Pennsylvania suffered the nation’s highest year-over-year grocery inflation rate at 8.2 percent, and Harris’s EV mandates and pro-China trade policies are undercutting workers across the country,” he added. Martin said that Teamsters will vote for Trump in spades because American workers were better off during the first Trump adminsitration than they are now. “American workers were safer and better off when President Trump was in office – rank-and-file workers know it, and that is why they will ignore their union bosses and will vote for the Trump-Vance ticket on November 5,” he said. The Teamsters have opted not to officially endorse a candidate in the race, marking the first time they have not supported a Democrat candidate for president since 1996. This is a major blow to Harris. That year, the union did not endorse anyone, with former President Bill Clinton missing out due to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Clinton had their support in 1992. However, this year’s non-endorsement is more reminiscent of 1988, when they rejected Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis. The endorsement instead went to Republican presidential nominee George H. W. Bush, who would win 41 states in the general election.",

    "title": "Trump Slams Kamala Harris Visit to Border ‘After Four Straight Years of Obliterating’ It",
    "author": "Elizabeth Weibel",
    "content": "Former President Donald Trump criticized Vice President Kamala Harris’s recent visit to the border, noting that it came after “four straight years of obliterating” the United States border. While speaking at an event in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, on Saturday, Trump mentioned Harris’s recent visit near the border in Douglas, Arizona, on Friday. During a speech from Arizona, Harris cast blame on Trump for doing “nothing to fix” the broken immigration system in the U.S. “Last night, after four straight years of obliterating our border, I watched this show that she put on,” Trump said. “Four years of the most incompetent border anywhere in the world in history, Kamala Harris traveled to the scene. In fact, she stood near where I put up border wall, that was her backdrop.” “And, in one of the most heinous crimes ever committed by any administration in American history, that’s what she did by allowing these millions of people. Millions and millions of people to come through our border and make our civilization very unsafe. It’s a civilization, very, very, unsafe. It’s a heritage,” Trump added. “Border czar Harris went to the border to lie in the most shameless and horrible way possible, at the very site where she released so much suffering, misery and death.” While news outlets such as the New York Times have tried to paint Harris as projecting a tough approach to the border, Harris recently released, according to Breitbart’s Neil Munro,  an “economic plan that assumes a loose border inflow of low-wage migrant workers, government-aided migrant consumers, and room-sharing migrant renters.” Included in Harris’s 2024 campaign promises were pledges to provide illegal aliens with amnesty, and to increase the flow of migrants into the U.S. As Breitbart News’s John Binder previously reported, during a recent interview with MSNBC’s  Stephanie Ruhle, Harris was asked what her administration would do for communities that had “taken in many” migrants. Harris referenced bipartisan legislation from Sen. James Lankford (R-OK), Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT), and Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ) that would increase immigration levels in the U.S., “codify the administration’s parole pipeline for migrants,” and would “expedite work permits” for illegal migrants coming to the southern border. A report released by the House Homeland Security Committee found that under the Biden-Harris administration, nearly eight million migrants had been welcomed in the U.S. The report also found that over 85 percent of migrants who had arrived at the southern border were being released into the U.S.",

    "author": "Olivia Rondeau",
    "content": "Former Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard called Vice President Kamala Harris’s Friday visit to the southern border “shameless” and referred to it as a “photo op” in a flaming social media post. Gabbard, who made headlines for endorsing former President Donald Trump in the race against Harris in August, made the fiery X post on Saturday morning: “Shameless. No other way to describe Kamala Harris’ photo op at Southern border, promising to secure it after allowing 10+ million illegal aliens in the past 3.5 years as border czar,” she wrote. “A shameless person feels no shame because they have no conscience. That’s Kamala Harris.” Harris traveled to Douglas, Arizona — her first time at the U.S.-Mexico border in over three years — to criticize former President Donald Trump for going against the bipartisan border bill, ABC News reported. “It was the strongest border security bill we have seen in decades. It was endorsed by the Border Patrol union. And it should be in effect today, producing results in real time, right now, for our country,” she said in her speech in the border town. A closer look at some of what the bill would have done, however, does not make it look strong. As Breitbart News’s John Binder pointed out, it would have: “But Donald Trump tanked it. He picked up the phone and called some friends in Congress and said, ‘Stop the bill,’” Harris continued. “He prefers to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. And the American people deserve a president who cares more about border security than playing political games and their personal political future.” In a recent appearance on the Shawn Ryan Show, Gabbard lamented over the number of people who have “streamed through our borders illegally.” The illegals pose a “direct threat to us here on our own soil,” the Hawaii politician said of her own visit to the southern border.",

    "title": "Donald Trump Vows to Prosecute Google at ‘Maximum Levels’ for Election Interference",
    "author": "Lucas Nolan",
    "content": "Former President Donald Trump threatened on Friday that he will request the criminal prosecution of Google “at maximum levels” when he returns to office, accusing the tech giant of “illegal activity” through its bias against him in search results. In a post on Truth Social, the former president claimed that Google “has illegally used a system of only revealing and displaying bad stories about Donald J. Trump” while simultaneously “only revealing good stories about Comrade Kamala Harris.” The post continues, “This is an ILLEGAL ACTIVITY, and hopefully the Justice Department will criminally prosecute them for this blatant Interference of Elections. If not, and subject to the Laws of our Country, I will request their prosecution, at the maximum levels, when I win the Election, and become President of the United States!” Trump’s vow to prosecute Google is likely based on many examples of election interference that have been revealed in the runup to the 2024 election. Most recently a Media Research Center (MRC) study demonstrated that the search giant is “padding” its results in favor of Kamala Harris: In the past, Google buried the campaign websites of Republican candidates. Now the search giant very clearly pads its search results about political candidates with leftist legacy news articles, many of which are hostile to Republicans and either neutral or favorable toward Democrats. Readers will have to sift through the biased news before they even see the organic results of their searches, let alone a candidate’s website. MRC Free Speech America researchers conducted searches on Sept. 6 for “donald trump presidential race 2024” and “kamala harris presidential race 2024” to determine where Google Search would position each candidate’s presidential campaign website. In both searches, news from leftist-biased legacy outlets like CNN and The New York Times populated the top of the search results. Former President Donald Trump’s campaign website appeared sixth in search results for “donald trump presidential race 2024.” But before reaching Trump’s website, readers would see options to click on seven articles from left-wing sources. The New York Times, Politico and The Washington Post were listed under the “Top Stories” panel. In June, an earlier MRC study revealed that Google was burying Donald Trump’s campaign site while pushing Joe Biden’s site to the top of searches while he was still in the race: The MRC’s research, conducted just days before tonight’s highly anticipated presidential debate between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, revealed stark differences in how Google presents search results for various candidates. When searching for a candidate’s name along with “presidential race 2024,” researchers found that President Biden’s campaign website appeared as the top result, while former President Trump’s website was notably absent from the first page of results. This discrepancy has led to accusations of election interference. MRC President Brent Bozell stated, “Google is blatantly interfering in the 2024 election.” The organization’s findings suggest that the issue extends beyond just these two candidates, with pro-life candidates seemingly receiving less favorable treatment in search rankings. Google also censored search results related to the assassination attempt at Trump’s July rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The internet giant attempted to play this censorship off as an innocent mistake: The primary point of contention centered around searches related to the recent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump. Breitbart News previously reported that users noted that when typing “assassination attempt on” into Google’s search bar, the auto-complete function did not suggest the recent incident involving Trump. Instead, it offered suggestions related to historical figures such as former President Ronald Reagan and musician Bob Marley. In response to these allegations, a Google spokesperson provided clarification to Fortune magazine. The company stated that no “manual action” was taken on the auto-complete predictions and that they are “working on improvements” to the feature. Regarding the absence of suggestions related to the assassination attempt, Google explained that their systems have “protections against Auto-complete predictions associated with political violence,” which were functioning as intended prior to the recent event. Breitbart News will continue to report on Google’s election interference and Donald Trump’s response to it.

    "title": "Netanyahu: Nasrallah’s Death a Message to Enemies and to Allies",
    "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
    "content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed his nation on Saturday night, telling them that the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was a victory for Israel and a warning to Iran. Netanyahu, speaking in Hebrew, said that Nasrallah was not just “a” terrorist, but “the” terrorist, responsible for the deaths not just of Israelis but also of many American and French citizens, among others. He said that the successful airstrike on Friday evening was a warning to Iran — the “regime of the ayatollah” — and repeated a warning he delivered in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly. “Whoever strikes us, we will strike them. … And today you know how true that is.” Netanyahu added that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar would be more amenable to a hostage deal, now that he “sees that Nasrallah is not coming to save him.” To those in the Middle East and the world terrorized by Iran and Hezbollah, Netanyahu said, the message of Friday’s attack was: “Israel stands with you.” He noted that the attack was broadly a message to Israel’s allies, without mentioning the United States. The Biden administration had been pushing for a ceasefire before that attack and reiterated that goal even while welcoming Nasrallah’s elimination. Netanyahu recounted the year since the October 7 terror attack, when Israel’s enemies hoped that it was “on the path to destruction.” He declared: “They understand how their hopes have been dashed.” Netanyahu concluded: “We are determined to continue striking at our enemies, to return our residents [to their homes], and to release all of the hostages, whom we do not forget about for a moment.” Update: The Prime Minister’s office released a transcript of Netanyahu’s statement, translated from Hebrew: “If someone rises up to kill you, kill him first.” Yesterday, the State of Israel eliminated the arch-murderer Hassan Nasrallah. We have settled accounts with someone who was responsible for the murders of countless Israelis and many nationals of other countries, including hundreds of Americans and dozens of French. Nasrallah was not just another terrorist, he was the terrorist. He was the axis of the axis, the main engine of Iran’s axis of evil. He and his people were the architects of the plan to destroy Israel. He was not only operated by Iran, he also frequently operated Iran. Therefore, at the beginning of the week, I came to the conclusion that the powerful blows that the IDF has been landing on Hezbollah in recent days were not enough. The elimination of Nasrallah is a necessary condition in achieving the objectives we have set: Returning the residents of the north safely to their homes, and changing the balance of power in the region for years. As long as Nasrallah was alive, he would have quickly rebuilt the capabilities we took from Hezbollah. Therefore, I gave the directive – and Nasrallah is no longer with us. His elimination advances the return of our residents to their homes in the north. It also advances the return of our hostages in the south. The more that Sinwar sees that Nasrallah will not be coming to his rescue, the greater are the chances for returning our hostages. I would like to thank the IDF, the Air Force, IDF Intelligence, the Mossad and the ISA for the great achievements, and not just yesterday. Citizens of Israel, We have great achievements but the work has still not been completed. In the coming days, we will face significant challenges and we will face them together. Nasrallah spoke about us as ‘spider webs.’ But instead of ‘spider webs’, he found the tendons of steel of a united and mighty nation that is determined to ensure its existence and its future. Not only has Hezbollah discovered this. The entire Middle East has discovered this. All those who oppose the axis of evil, all those who are fighting under the violent dictatorship of Iran and its proxies in Lebanon, Syria, Iran itself and other places, they are all filled with hope today. I say to the citizens of those countries: Israel stands with you. And to the ayatollahs’ regime I say: Those who strike us, we strike them. There is no place in Iran or the Middle East that the long arm of Israel cannot reach. Today, you already know that this is correct. Citizens of Israel, These are momentous days. We are at what will be seen as a historic turning point. One year ago, on October 7, our enemies attacked us and thought that Israel was on the road to being wiped out. One year later, blow after blow, achievement after achievement, they understand how their hopes have dissipated. Israel has momentum; we are winning. We are determined to continue striking our enemies, to return our residents to their homes, and to return all of our hostages. We do not forget them even for a moment. My brothers and sisters, dear citizens of Israel, today I tell you emphatically, again: Together we will fight and – with G-d’s help – together we will win.”",

    "title": "Exclusive — Jon LeFevre: VoterMaps Project Can Help Turn Millions of Americans into Voter ‘Fraud Detectors’",
    "author": "Sean Moran",
    "content": "John LeFevre, a financial author and founder of Votermaps.org, on Breitbart News Saturday said that the VoterMaps project would allow Americans to become get-out-the-vote activists, poll watchers, and fraud detectives. The VoterMaps project is essentially a public database to help Americans become “vote detectives” and look for inconsistencies in voter registration. “VoterMaps is a searchable, map-based database of all voter histories and current ballot status — updated in real-time. House by house. Block by block. State by state,” the VoterMaps project states. “We level the information playing field transparently, allowing all citizens to be activists, influencers, fraud detectors, and champions of free and fair elections.” LeFevre said that he helped start the VoterMaps project given that the media landscape is in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris and given that there are many leftist organizations dedicated to harvesting mail-in ballots. LeFevre said, “I think that there are few key issues that we have been looking to address. First of all, when you look at the overall landscape, in terms of corporate media that is 100 percent complicit with the Kamala Harris machine, driving propaganda 24/7 … if you look at voters, whether they’re independents or left-leaning, the amount of ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’ that is out there is so pervasive and almost impossible to penetrate.” He explained, “It doesn’t matter if the illegal immigrants vote, they just need them on the roll, so they could go out and harvest these ballots from mostly low-income, low information, high-density, urban, lower socioeconomic classes voters and collect the ballot.” LeFevre said that the database will help turn tens of millions of Americans into activists. He said, “Now is their chance, anyone can be a get-out-the-vote activist, anybody can be a poll watcher, anybody can be a fraud detective, because the map becomes a virtual crime scene.” Breitbart News Saturday airs on SirusXM Patriot 125 from 10:00 A.M. to 1:00 P.M.

    "title": "Border Patrol Union Roasts Kamala Harris’s Border Visit: ‘She Was Nowhere to Be Found’",
    "author": "Olivia Rondeau",
    "content": "The official union of the U.S. Border Patrol fact-checked Vice President Kamala Harris after her visit to the U.S.-Mexico border on Friday, saying “She was nowhere to be found when we needed her.” “Fact check on Harris speech in Douglas, Arizona: Today, VP Harris claimed that she played a role in increasing Border Patrol Agent overtime pay,” the National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) wrote in an X post: “This couldn’t be further from the truth. As with all things border related she was nowhere to be found when we needed her,” the union added. In an appearance on Fox News, NBPC vice president Art Del Cueto said that Harris only spoke with two members of Border Patrol management, did not speak to any agents, and was only there for a 20-minute “photo op”: “That’s all she did. President Trump actually cares and he’s actually gone down there and met with boots on the ground,” Del Cueto added. While visiting the border town of Douglas, Arizona, Harris slammed former President Donald Trump for not “fixing” the problem. Referring to the failed bipartisan border bill, the Democrat candidate claimed Trump “tanked it.” “It was the strongest border security bill we have seen in decades. It was endorsed by the Border Patrol union, and it should be in effect today, producing results in real time right now for our country,” she said during her speech. “But Donald Trump tanked it… because, you see, he prefers to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem.” “VP Harris asserted in Arizona that CBP needed more resources,” the NBPC said in another X post: “We have apprehended over 8 million illegal immigrants over the last 4 years and now you realize we need more help 38 days before the election.” Trump posted the union’s response to Harris’s visit on his Truth Social page.",

    "title": "Author Fran Lebowitz Tells Bill Maher: ‘Biden Should Dissolve the Supreme Court’",
    "author": "David Ng",
    "content": "Author and cultural critic Fran Lebowitz has articulated what a growing number of people on the left have come to believe: the Supreme Court is illegitimate and should be done away with in its current form. On Friday, Fran Lebowitz appeared on HBO’s Real Time with Bill Maher where she advocated for President Joe Biden to “dissolve the Supreme Court” — in effect, allowing the executive branch to seize control of the judicial branch, in direct violation of the U.S. Constitution. Her extreme view surprised host Bill Maher, who looked taken aback before joking, “Good to see you’re centrist.” Lebowitz argued that the Supreme Court is a “disgrace” because it is “completely his” — a reference to former President Donald Trump. “It’s so disgraceful, this court, that it shouldn’t even be allowed to be called the Supreme Court,” she said to enthusiastic applause from Maher’s studio audience. “It’s an insult to Motown,” she quipped. “Basically, it’s a harem. It’s Trump’s harem,” she said. Lebowitz was commenting on the high court’s July ruling on presidential immunity, deciding in a 6-3 decision that presidents are covered by limited immunity from criminal prosecutions for official actions taken while in office. The ruling was widely seen as a major victory for Trump in his ongoing battle against the Biden-Harris administration’s weaponization of the Justice Department against him. On Friday’s show, Lebowitz incorrectly interpreted the ruling as making the president a “king” who “can do whatever you want.” As a result, she argued in apparent seriousness, Biden is able to dissolve the Court. But the Supreme Court’s ruling states immunity only applies to “actions within his [the president’s] conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority.” Since the Constitution enumerates separate branches of government, Biden would not be able to take the action she is urging. Maher didn’t challenge Lebowitz on her view at length, though he clearly thought it was bonkers. “Oh, come on,” he replied. During the same show, Lebowitz smeared the residents of states like Tennessee and Arizona as unintelligent and even joked that the United States should gift Arizona to Russian President Vladimir Putin in exchange for Ukraine’s safety. Democrats are increasingly pushing for a radical re-shaping of the Supreme Court, motivated by the reversal of Roe v. Wade and other rulings they don’t like. Among those supporting this extremist view is apparently Democrat presidential nominee Kamala Harris. As Breitbart News reported, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) recently said Kamala Harris would support packing the Supreme Court under a bill he has been pushing if she were to become president. Packing the court would involve expanding the number of justices from the current nine to an unspecified number. Many on the left also want to limit the number of years a justice can serve. After the clips of Lebowitz’s comments went viral, the phrase “Howard Stern” became a trending topic on X/Twitter. Follow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg. Have a tip?

    "title": "VIDEO — ‘She Should Be Prosecuted’: Trump Blasts Pelosi over Husband’s Visa Stock Trades Prior to DOJ Lawsuit",
    "author": "Amy Furr",
    "content": "Former President Donald Trump took a firm stance on Thursday against Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) regarding her husband’s Visa stock trades. Trump, who is running against Vice President Kamala Harris (D) for the White House in 2024, said he believes the former House speaker should be prosecuted, the New York Post reported on Friday. His comments came during a press conference at Trump Tower in New York: Nancy Pelosi has a little problem because her husband sold their Visa stock. They had a lot of Visa stock, one day before Visa, it was announced that Visa is being sued by the Department of Justice. Think of that. Nancy Pelosi sold vast amounts of Visa stock one day before the big lawsuit that we all read about a few days ago, was brought against Visa. You think it was luck? … Nancy Pelosi should be prosecuted for that. The Post cited financial disclosures which show that Pelosi’s husband, Paul, “unloaded 2,000 shares of Visa stock worth between $500,000 and $1 million on July 1,” noting that on Tuesday, “less than three months after the massive transaction, Visa was hit with a DOJ lawsuit alleging that the company illegally monopolized the debit card market.” Trump suggested that the former House speaker was warned about the lawsuit and told her husband. Breitbart News senior contributor and president of the Government Accountability Institute, author Peter Schweizer, revealed in 2011 that Nancy Pelosi “apparently bought $1 million to $5 million of Visa stock in one of the most sought-after and profitable initial public offerings (IPO) in American history, thwarted serious credit card reform for two years, and then watched her investment skyrocket 203%,” Breitbart News reported at the time. Schweizer and the late Andrew Breitbart worked to ban members of Congress from using nonpublic information to their own profit via the STOCK (Stop Trading On Congressional Knowledge) Act, Breitbart News reported in March 2012. “The STOCK Act will make it illegal for members of Congress and their staffs to use material, nonpublic information to inform their private investments and will impose more rigorous public disclosure requirements on all trades by lawmakers,” the article said. In March 2024 Breitbart News reported that research showing politicians made trades worth over $1 billion in 2023 bolstered a campaign to ban members of Congress from stock trading. “‘Speaker Pelosi does not own any stocks, and she has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions,’ a spokesperson for Nancy told The Post earlier this week,” the outlet reported.",

That’s not all you’re seeing. Okay.” Which Hayes agreed with. Hinojosa then stated, “But she did make the switch. And you and I were just like, oh my gosh, did she just talk about DREAMers? Did she just say that she’s going to really attempt to create a pathway to citizenship?” Hayes responded, “That phrase stuck out to me, because that phrase — and you’ve been covering immigration longer than I have, but I’ve been covering it for a minute as well — that phrase was the center of so many debates and policy debates and legislation and McCain-Kennedy and all these things, [it] has been annihilated from the national public discourse.

James Clyburn (D-SC) said that he has “no idea” how to explain why 2024 Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris hasn’t visited the border in three years, but “she went to the countries of origin to try and find out exactly how we could tackle this problem from the very origin of it rather than hang out at the border.” And “I don’t know that visiting the border is all you need to do to tackle this problem.” Co-host Danny Freeman asked, “This is Harris’ first visit to the border as a presidential candidate. Her last visit was back in 2021, when she was given the mission of tackling root causes of migration. Congressman, why hasn’t she visited in three years?” Clyburn responded, “I have no idea how to answer that question. I do know that, when she was first given this job, she went to the countries of origin to try and find out exactly how we could tackle this problem from the very origin of it rather than hang out at the border. Now, while she was attorney general of California, a border state, she dealt with this issue. … So, she’s been to the border many, many times. So, I don’t know that visiting the border is all you need to do to tackle this problem. You had James Lankford and Sen. Murphy from — a Republican from Oklahoma [and] Sen. Murphy, the Democrat from up in Connecticut working together. They produced a bipartisan bill, which she endorsed, as did President Joe Biden.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",

They didn’t take it seriously enough. That is true.” Host Anderson Cooper said, “[A]t the end of the debate between them, Donald Trump sort of finally got around to a line which was probably workshopped ahead of time and that he just neglected to actually get to it until the end of the debate, which was, why didn’t you do it — what have you been doing the last three years on the border, essentially? That’s the pushback from Republicans.” Jones responded, “That’s a good point. Listen, it took them too long. It took them too long. They didn’t take it seriously enough. That is true. But then, when they tried to get everybody together to fix it, Donald Trump wouldn’t let them and they got it done anyway, all that’s true, and she should just own it.” Earlier in the segment, Jones said that the administration has “secured” the border, but it took them a while to do so.

    "title": "Exclusive — Sam Brown Discusses Book ‘Alive Day’ Chronicling Life-Altering Battlefield Explosion: ‘That’s Where I Found God’",
    "author": "Nick Gilbertson",
    "content": "Nevada’s Republican U.S. Senate nominee, Ret. Army Capt. Sam Brown, joined Sirus XM’s Breitbart News Saturday, where he discussed his new book, Alive Day: Finding Hope and Purpose After Losing Everything, which chronicles the fateful day he was severely burned on the battlefield in Afghanistan and how he found meaning in the midst of it. Breitbart News Washington Bureau Chief Matthew Boyle asked Brown about precisely what an “Alive Day” is. “An Alive Day is something that … I heard of out of the Wounded Warrior community,” Brown said. “And it’s the day that we all sort of celebrate that we could have, should have, you know, expected to die on the battlefield, but we didn’t, you know, either due to miraculous circumstances, or, our fellow service members getting to us and, either, in my case, smothering flames, you know; for others, it’s, you know, getting tourniquets on before they bleed out, or whatever. So it’s a type of a new birthday.” LISTEN: Brown said that he treats and celebrates his Alive Day like his birthday, and his actual birthday does not carry the same importance for him. “So my Alive Day was 16 years ago this month,” Brown said. “It’s a day that I was in Afghanistan, I was a young infantry platoon leader, and some other, you know, friendly forces from our unit came under fire, needed support, and, you know, just like any good military member ought to do is when you got friendlies under fire, you got to run to the sound of those guns and go, you know, provide support.” It was on the way to provide support that Brown’s platoon hit a roadside bomb, killing one of his soldiers and wounding Brown and three others. He told Boyle that he found God while critically injured in the desert. “In the midst of that, at 24 years old, you know, laying there in the, in the desert, thinking I was about to die, actually wanting death to help me escape the pain, that’s where I found God,” he said. “And that’s that’s where I found a new life when my soldiers came to me and yelled out to me that you know that, ‘Sir, I’ve got you,’ and then put themselves in harm’s way to smother those flames.” Brown was medically evacuated to the Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas. The intensive care unit is where Brown, who would undergo dozens of reconstructive surgeries, met Amy, a nurse with whom he would fall in love and marry. “Amy worked in the ICU of the burn unit, and I, you know, had just come in, didn’t know her at all,” Brown explained. “In fact, she met me before I met her because I came in, you know, on a ventilator. I was intubated and, you know, unconscious. But as kind of the days turned into weeks and weeks into months, I eventually did meet her.” It was at his “most vulnerable” that Amy was there for him. “This was kind of the lowest point of my life. I was basically in bandages from head to toe every day,” Brown recalled. “I could barely feed myself. I couldn’t bathe or change my dressings at all. So just, you know, the most vulnerable, weakest point I could be, as well as having just lost my personal identity. I mean, my face was burned so severely that it was scarred and ended up requiring, you know, in total, I had over 30 surgeries over my whole body… for reconstruction. And in the midst of that, Amy, you know, she was there and loved me and supported me when it was hard to see how anyone could love me.” The Browns have been married for fifteen years and have three children: two sons, ages thirteen and nine, and an eleven-year-old daughter. “She’s just an incredible woman, a woman of God, and served her country, both in the hospital there as well as in Iraq in ’09 and ’10, and just my best friend and also just a key part of this campaign for Senate here with us,” Brown said. Boyle asked Brown how he would apply lessons he learned from his Alive Day and recovery in the U.S. Senate if he defeats Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) in November. “One of the lessons I took off the battlefield was the life I live is not my own, and… that doesn’t appear to be a common perspective for some folks in D.C. as well as, you know, realizing that the mission is bigger than any individual,” Brown said. “We’ve got a mission to accomplish here, to serve our fellow Americans, to save this country, to be, you know, a leader in this world, to, you know, help the world find peace through strength, and so these are some of the things I distilled out and that I hope to be able to take to Washington, DC, on behalf of Nevadans after this election.” Brown also emphasized he has learned hope can be found in even the most difficult and arduos struggles and conflicts. “Yes, I went through a very, you know, literally, fiery crucible, but all of us go through some form of suffering, and that’s really the bigger point of the book, Alive Day, is we all at some point find ourselves at some sort of life-changing moment, something unexpected, some form of suffering,” he noted. “Sometimes it’s internal and quiet and hidden, and sometimes it’s really visible, like my wounds. But we can find hope, we can find peace, and we can find purpose in the midst of that. And so I just encourage everyone listening, whether it’s you or someone you know, this book can be an encouragement.” Alive Day is available for purchase on Amazon.

    "title": "Biden Reacts to Nasrallah Death by Calling for Ceasefire Deals, Again",
    "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
    "content": "President Joe Biden issued a statement on Saturday welcoming the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli airstrike, but repeating his call for ceasefire deals in Gaza and Lebanon, despite Israel’s advance toward victory. The full text of Biden’s statement is as follows: Hassan Nasrallah and the terrorist group he led, Hezbollah, were responsible for killing hundreds of Americans over a four-decade reign of terror. His death from an Israeli airstrike is a measure of justice for his many victims, including thousands of Americans, Israelis, and Lebanese civilians. The strike that killed Nasrallah took place in the broader context of the conflict that began with Hamas’s massacre on October 7, 2023. Nasrallah, the next day, made the fateful decision to join hands with Hamas and open what he called a “northern front” against Israel. The United States fully supports Israel’s right to defend itself against Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, and any other Iranian-supported terrorist groups. Just yesterday, I directed my Secretary of Defense to further enhance the defense posture of U.S. military forces in the Middle East region to deter aggression and reduce the risk of a broader regional war. Ultimately, our aim is to de-escalate the ongoing conflicts in both Gaza and Lebanon through diplomatic means. In Gaza, we have been pursuing a deal backed by the UN Security Council for a ceasefire and the release of hostages. In Lebanon, we have been negotiating a deal that would return people safely to their homes in Israel and southern Lebanon. It is time for these deals to close, for the threats to Israel to be removed, and for the broader Middle East region to gain greater stability. The Times of Israel reported that the Biden administration was angry about the airstrike because Israel did not inform it until the operation was in progress, and appeared to have strung the White House along about a ceasefire. Israel had reason to worry that the White House might not keep the operation secret. The head of intelligence at Biden’s National Security Council, Maher Bitar, is a former radical pro-Palestinian activist. Moreover, President Barack Obama was thought to have leaked information to the media about a potential Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities in order to warn the Iranians and prevent the Israelis from attacking. The Biden administration has tried, throughout the war that erupted with the Hamas terror attack last October 7, to prevent Israel from destroying terrorist organizations. Vice President Kamala Harris warned Israel against entering Rafah to destroy Hamas. Joel B.

    "title": "Exclusive – Sen. Ted Budd: Harris, Democrats ‘Want Problems to Get Worse’ So Government Can Increase Power",
    "author": "Bradley Jaye",
    "content": "Donald Trump is campaigning hard in North Carolina and will win the state again, despite Vice President Kamala Harris’s gaslighting and the Biden-Harris administration’s potentially illegal electioneering using American taxpayer dollars, Sen. Ted Budd (R-NC) told host Matt Boyle on Breitbart News Saturday. Budd discussed the state of the race and explained Democrat tactics to prevent Trump from winning the state a third straight election cycle. “This is a state that you can never take for granted,” Budd said, explaining that Trump and his campaign are “doing the work” it takes to win. Michael Whatley, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, hails from the Tarheel State and has a special appreciation for what it takes to win there. Budd said Whatley and co-chair Lara Trump are doing a fantastic job interpreting and applying the lessons of the 2020 election. “They did a great job getting the ballot trued up and making sure that those that were not legitimately on the voter rolls, getting them removed,” Budd told Boyle. “I think the number that they had announced yesterday with about 774,000 people not legitimately on the rolls – they were dead, they were duplicates, something like that – that were removed. So, great work.” Above all, Republicans are being much more proactive this cycle. “Michael Whatley made the point that you can’t sue after Election Day,” Budd said. “You got to get out in front of it. And they’ve done a great job, learned a lot of lessons in 2020, so making sure that the ballot has integrity is one of their main focuses right now.” Budd has also led in calling out Democrats, raising questions on the Senate floor about whether or not Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are using taxpayer resources to register Democrat voters and carefully laying out evidence in a scheme called “Bidenbucks” previously reported by Breitbart News. “The Biden White House, with an executive order, asked every single federal agency… to come up with a plan to increase the voter turnout,” Budd explained, estimating the number of agencies at around 400. “But what we saw is that, in voter registration, is that 50 left wing groups show up to these things.” “They’re using taxpayer dollars, Republican, Democrat, Independent dollars, for hardworking people to generate Democrat turnout, and it’s completely unfair, and we’ve asked them to stand down,” he added, noting that the administration’s efforts appear to have paused after public criticism. “We just want to expose this and show how corrupt this is. You can’t use taxpayer dollars for election engineering – that’s unconstitutional and illegal, and we’re calling it out.” Harris has tried to avoid her role in the administration’s disastrous border plan that has ushered in millions illegally across the southern border. She traveled to the border in Arizona Friday night – when most Americans are not tuned into politics – to give a speech touting the Senate’s defeated pro-migration border bill she said she would pass. Boyle pointed out that Republicans and Democrats opposed the plan, and asked why Harris has not taken any actions on the border that she mentioned in her speech during her almost four years in the White House. “She’s completely gaslighting the American people, trying to present a distorted reality of recent past,” Budd said. “She’s completely failed her job. She’s very dangerous. The fentanyl problems we’ve seen, the young lives that are lost, that will never get back. I mean, it’s just heartbreaking. And that’s all Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. So they get an F or worse, if there was a grade worse for what they’ve done over the last three and a half years. I mean, these are executive orders that have allowed it to be worse. Had they just kept the Trump policies, we would have been in such a better place right now.” Budd said the American people won’t buy it. “If you look at the polling in Arizona, that speech is not going to cut it, because she’s way behind,” he said, insisting Harris is inescapably tied to the administration’s border failure. “Joe Biden says, when she speaks in regards to the border, she speaks for me. And so it is absolutely her failure over the past three and a half years.” Boyle said Harris’s team choosing a sleepy Friday night for a speech is consistent with their decision to limit her access to media and interviews. “Everything that she does when she does actually answer, you’re like, Oh, now I see why she was so bad at her job,” Budd told Boyle. “For instance, you know, the problem that’s causing houses to just skyrocket in price is regulation. She’s for more regulation, right? So everything she does would make it worse. She wants to give people $25,000 towards a house. That would make the price of houses go up even more. You don’t get at the root of the problem. It’s almost like the very mechanics of their thinking don’t allow these problems to be solved.” Budd contrasted Democrats’ approach to the America First agenda of Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance (R-OH). “Everything that [Democrats] do makes their life worse. Everything that Donald Trump and JD Vance want to do makes people’s lives better, makes them able to afford groceries, their power bill, putting gas in their car,” he said. “The stuff that was simple four years ago is now absolutely a train wreck under Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. She’ll only make it worse.” Harris, in one of the more bizarre episodes in this campaign, now claims to own a gun, despite a long record of anti-Second Amendment positions. Trump, in a recent exclusive interview with Boyle, said, “If she has a gun, she should say what kind of a gun.” “It’s ridiculous,” Budd said. “She won’t say what she has, you know, is it a long gun? Is it a handgun? Is it a shotgun? It’s ridiculous. She knows nothing about that.” “She is not pro Second Amendment, and she is for gun confiscation,” he added. Budd said Harris and the Democrats’ anti-Second Amendment policies are core to their power politics. “They want problems to get worse, so then they can blame guns,” he explained. “So I think in some sort of sick way, they don’t mind things getting worse for Americans, because then they can blame the gun. They can take it away from people, try to change the Second Amendment, and then they’re back in control. So I think this is ultimately about controlling people, and that seems to be the MO of the Democrat Party, at least the modern Democrat Party.” Breitbart News Saturday airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Eastern.

    "title": "Exclusive — Rob Schneider: The ‘Real Weapon Against Tyranny Is Free Speech’",
    "author": "Hannah Knudsen",
    "content": "The “real weapon against tyranny is free speech,” actor, comedian, and author of the new book You Can Do It!: Speak Your Mind, America, Rob Schneider, said during an interview on Breitbart News Saturday. “The idea … really, is there seems to be a contraction of free speech, and it’s happening, whereas even the government has been proved that they’re violating Americans’ First Amendment rights, you know. Thank God for Elon Musk, who exposed what happened to Twitter,” he said, touching on the collusion between tech companies and the U.S. government. They were working, he continued, to “silence Americans who had a different opinion and didn’t want to go along with the government narrative.” “You can just imagine that they did the same thing to Facebook, because … Mark Zuckerberg admitted it. He said, ‘Yeah, we did this, man,’ and I think he, for whatever reasons, he admitted it a week ago. It was happening everywhere. And then, you know, Google, of course … has CIA connections and won’t admit anything or say anything, but through Dr. Robert Epstein, we know now that Google has suppressed conservative causes, and they are also colluding with the CIA and the government to suppress stuff that they don’t want to hear. So that’s unique,” he said, explaining that it is crucial to expose this and say, “Do we want to continue this contraction of, you know, the most basic of our freedoms … the First Amendment, our right to unfettered free speech?” LISTEN: “And I think it’s … if there’s anything the Founding Fathers said to us even more than guns to protect us from tyranny was, you know, the First Amendment before guns,” he said. “The real weapon against tyranny is free speech.” Schneider also walked through how comedy is a key social construct in the United States and can be used to fight tyranny. “So basically, the only way to take down tyranny is …  it crumbles. And I think I agree with James Lindsay. The idea of tyranny is, it seems like, if you take a look at the Soviet Union, it seems like it’s going to go on forever. It’s very strong, and then it all collapses at once. And part of that collapse comes from — you know, an important part of that is the people no longer taking it seriously and no longer being afraid of it,” he said. “And the way to do that –is to break it apart — is when people started laughing at it and mocking it, and that’s important. So — and I think that happened” in the United States in the past, he explained, also talking about another turning point in the country, which was the weaponization of government agencies during the Obama years, as well as the coronavirus. Schneider also blasted the Democrat Party, identifying it as part of the problem. “When you realize that 70 percent of all the wealth in America is owned by Democrats, you realize the party of the people is now the Republican Party,” he said. Of Democrats, he continued, “Whatever is going to help them gain power. They don’t care what it is. They’re not a democratic organization anymore. They know they don’t support the democratic republic that we are founded under. They just — they make decisions for the Democratic voters,” he added.

    "title": "VIDEO: Tennessee Dam Nearly Breaks due to Hurricane Helene’s Rainfall",
    "author": "Amy Furr",
    "content": "Massive floodwaters nearly caused a disaster along the Nolichucky River in Tennessee after Hurricane Helene wreaked havoc in several states. Officials with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) feared the rising waters could result in an imminent failure of the Nolichucky Dam in Greeneville, Fox Weather reported on Saturday. In an update early Saturday, TVA shared video footage of the massive amounts of water rushing over the dam. “The Nolichucky River has crested, and the dam remains intact. Water is currently receding by approximately one foot per hour. Our Dam Safety teams are in the process of assessing the condition of the dam to determine next steps. We are estimating water levels reached 8 feet over the record elevation,” officials explained: Authorities have begun urging residents who live downstream of the dam to evacuate after it sustained cracks as the area tries to recover from the heavy rainfall the hurricane brought, the Weather Channel reported on Saturday. Meanwhile, the National Weather Service (NWS) warned that if the dam failed to operate correctly, the water could reach all the way to West Allens Bridge Road in approximately 20 minutes, per the Fox article. “The town of Erwin was also along the path of danger from the Nolichucky River. The town is already experiencing flooding from the record rains and was the site of a daring rescue of dozens of hospital staff and patients who spent hours on the roof of the Unicoi County Hospital after floodwaters surged into town,” the outlet said. More video footage shows floodwaters after they washed away a section of a bridge in the area as cars waited on one side of it: Greene County Chief Deputy David Beverly said, “We think for your safety it’d be better to evacuate and go to the shelters or if you have a place to go, if you live within a mile of the Nolichucky dam there on the actual highway or downriver of the dam.”",

    "title": "AP Calls Terrorist Nasrallah a ‘Pragmatist’; Omits Hezbollah Murders of Americans",
    "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
    "content": "The Associated Press published an obituary of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah that referred to him as a “pragmatist” and omitted Hezbollah’s role in murdering hundreds of Americans, among other terror victims. As Breitbart News reported, Nasrallah was killed Friday evening in an Israeli airstrike; his death was confirmed Saturday. The AP obituary declared: “Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah transformed the militant group into a potent regional force.” It described Nasrallah’s rise through the terrorist ranks, his wars against Israel, and his decline in popularity after bringing Hezbollah into the Syrian civil war. But it omitted essential facts about Nasrallah, including his role in mass murder throughout the Middle East, his targeting of civilians, and Hezbollah’s role in murdering Americans. At one point, the AP’s obituary declared: “A fiery orator viewed as an extremist in the U.S. and much of the West, as well as in some oil-rich Gulf Arab countries, he was also considered a pragmatist compared with the firebrand militants who dominated Hezbollah after its founding in 1982, during Lebanon’s civil war.” The obituary omitted the fact — noted in the White House response — that Hezbollah had been responsible for hundreds of American deaths, including the bombing of the U.S. Marines barracks in Beirut in 1983. President Joe Biden noted in a statement: Hassan Nasrallah and the terrorist group he led, Hezbollah, were responsible for killing hundreds of Americans over a four-decade reign of terror. His death from an Israeli airstrike is a measure of justice for his many victims, including thousands of Americans, Israelis, and Lebanese civilians. (Biden closed his statement by reiterating his call for a ceasefire.) Fifty-eight French soldiers were also murdered in the barracks attack, leading Louis Sarkozy, son of former French president Nicolas Sarkozy, to praise Israel for eliminating Nasrallah. The mainstream media have a habit of praising terrorist leaders when they are killed. In 2019, the Washington Post called ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi an “austere religious scholar” after he was killed by U.S. special forces. Joel B.

    "title": "Poland, Baltic States Demand EU Funds for ‘Defensive Line’ Along Borders with Russia and Belarus",
    "author": "Breitbart London",
    "content": "HELSINKI (AP) – NATO members Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland will seek European Union funding to build a network of bunkers, barriers, distribution lines and military warehouses along their borders with Russia and Belarus, Estonia’s officials said Saturday. The three Baltic countries initially announced the plan for a “Baltic Defense Line” in January. In May, Poland announced a similar project called the “Eastern Shield” with a purpose to strengthen its borders with the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad and Belarus. “The need for a (Baltic) defense line stems from the security situation and supports NATO’s new forward defense concept,” Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur said in a statement, adding that “it is extremely important to coordinate our activities with Poland.” “At the same time, it strengthens the security of the European Union and the military defense of its borders, which is why we clearly see that the EU could also financially support the project,” he said. The defense ministers of the four European countries located on NATO’s eastern flank met in the southeastern Latvian city of Daugavpils on Friday to discuss the project’s funding. They didn’t specify how much financial aid Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland would be seeking for the project from Brussels but noted in a joint statement that “Russia´s war against Ukraine has shown that creating physical obstacles on an open ground with no natural defensive cover is paramount even in technologically advanced warfare.” The ministers said that external threats at the Baltic-Polish frontier are increasingly growing and ramping up fortifications along the border with Russia and Belarus “remains a high-priority contributing to our pledge to defend every inch of (NATO) territory.” In Estonia, the smallest of the four countries with a population 1.3 million, the establishment of the border defense line is planned in three stages starting in 2025, the Defense Ministry said. Officials in Tallinn said earlier this year that Estonia is to construct up to 600 bunkers along its 333-kilometer (207-mile) border with Russia in the coming years at an estimated cost of 60 million euros ($67 million). The project is likely, however, to face difficulties and delays because the bunkers will have to be built on private land. The Baltic-Polish defense line excludes coastal defenses on the Baltic Sea that is shared by the four countries. No mines, barbed wire, anti-tank weapons or other such devices would be deployed in peacetime along the border fortifications, according to Estonia’s defense officials.",

    "title": "Confirmed: Mass Murderer Nasrallah Dead; Media Mourn, Biden Wants Ceasefire",
    "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
    "content": "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) declared Saturday, and Hezbollah confirmed, that terrorist mass murderer Hassan Nasrallah had been killed in an airstrike Friday evening in his headquarters deep under civilian buildings in Beirut. As Breitbart News reported, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu approved the airstrike from his hotel room in New York City, then addressed the United Nations General Assembly while the mission was being carried out. Netanyahu left a press conference, apparently after being informed of the attack, in which bunker-busting bombs exploded underneath buildings in southern Beirut. Aid the devastation, Nasrallah’s death could not be confirmed. The IDF said, tentatively, that it believe Nasrallah had been killed, together with other leaders of Hezbollah. But Iranian news sources pushed misinformation to western media outlets, saying Nasrallah was alive, safe, and well. The Associated Press (AP) described Nasrallah as a “pragmatist,” downplaying his culpability in mass murder in Syria and elsewhere. It obscured his commitment to destroying Israel and his hatred toward America and the west. Nasrallah, 64, rose to lead the Iranian-backed terror group as it carried out an insurgency against Israeli forces that had occupied southern Lebanon to prevent terrorists from firing rockets at communities in northern Israel. When Israel withdrew in 2000, he became a hero in the Arab and Muslim worlds. His stature increased after 2006, when Hezbollah started the Second Lebanon War and fought Israel to a draw after the international community intervened. But Nasrallah soon became a hated figure as well, after Hezbollah joined the Syrian civil war that erupted in the Arab Spring of 2011. Hezbollah participated in atrocities against Sunni Muslims and others, as Iran propped up dictator Bashar al-Assad. Many Lebanese people, outside of Hezbollah’s narrow Shiite constituency, resented Hezbollah’s role in Lebanon, which allowed Iran to control the country and to turn it into a base for future attacks against Israel. In its obituary for Nasrallah, the AP also completely omitted Hezbollah’s role in terror against the U.S., notably its role in the bombing of the U.S. Marines barracks in Beirut in 1983, which killed 241 servicemen. It was also involved in terror and criminal enterprises worldwide, with tentacles reaching as far as Latin America and Africa, where its operatives raised and laundered money through the “blood diamonds” wars of the 1990s that horrified the world. IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said Saturday that Nasrallah had hidden under women and children, and declared that Israel would continue its fight against Hezbollah until it could no longer threaten northern Israel. The Biden administration was reportedly angry about the attack. As Breitbart News noted, Israel only informed the U.S. about the attack on Nasrallah while it was already in progress, probably because Israel did not trust the Biden administration to keep its plans secret. The Biden administration was already angry at Israel’s apparent rejection of a proposed 21-day ceasefire in Lebanon, believing that Netanyahu had strung the White House along to buy time. There are several questions now: whether Israel will launch a ground invasion to destroy the rest of a shattered Hezbollah; whether Iran will intervene in Lebanon to save its terrorist proxy; and whether the people of Lebanon, plagued for so many decades by war, will be able to enjoy peace and sovereignty. One thing is certain: one of the worst terrorists and mass murderers in the world is dead, thanks to a war he launched, unprovoked, against civilians. Update: Following publication of this article, President Joe Biden issued a statement on the White House website in which he praised the killing of Nasrallah but reiterated his desire for a ceasefire, rather than eliminating Hezbollah: Hassan Nasrallah and the terrorist group he led, Hezbollah, were responsible for killing hundreds of Americans over a four-decade reign of terror. His death from an Israeli airstrike is a measure of justice for his many victims, including thousands of Americans, Israelis, and Lebanese civilians. The strike that killed Nasrallah took place in the broader context of the conflict that began with Hamas’s massacre on October 7, 2023. Nasrallah, the next day, made the fateful decision to join hands with Hamas and open what he called a “northern front” against Israel. The United States fully supports Israel’s right to defend itself against Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, and any other Iranian-supported terrorist groups. Just yesterday, I directed my Secretary of Defense to further enhance the defense posture of U.S. military forces in the Middle East region to deter aggression and reduce the risk of a broader regional war. Ultimately, our aim is to de-escalate the ongoing conflicts in both Gaza and Lebanon through diplomatic means. In Gaza, we have been pursuing a deal backed by the UN Security Council for a ceasefire and the release of hostages. In Lebanon, we have been negotiating a deal that would return people safely to their homes in Israel and southern Lebanon. It is time for these deals to close, for the threats to Israel to be removed, and for the broader Middle East region to gain greater stability. Joel B.

    "author": "Amy Furr",
    "content": "Forty-seven people reportedly died as Hurricane Helene wreaked havoc across the southeastern portion of the United States. Authorities fear the death toll will rise in the coming days as cleanup continues following the storm, which was downgraded to a post-tropical cyclone on Friday, Reuters reported Saturday, noting that several states endured heavy rains and flooding. The outlet said: At least 3.25 million customers woke up early on Saturday without power across five states, with authorities warning it could be several days before services were fully restored. The worst outages were in South Carolina with more than 1 million homes and businesses without power, and Georgia with 777,000 without power. Residents in North Carolina experienced major rainfall: 29.6 inches at Busick and 24.2 inches at Mount Mitchell, USA Today reported on Saturday. “Helene made landfall at about 11:10 p.m. ET Thursday near Perry, Florida, becoming the first known Category 4 storm to hit Florida’s Big Bend region since records began in 1851,” the article reported. Aftermath: Aerial Footage Seen of Tampa Area After Hurricane Helene Passed Through “The storm continued its push across western Kentucky on Saturday, and is expected to slowly move southeast, then east along the Kentucky-Tennessee border through the weekend, the National Hurricane Center said,” it continued. CBS News reported on Saturday that 1,600 flights were cancelled as a result of the storm. The outlet showed video footage of major flooding in Florida and National Guardsmen airlifting people from a hospital roof in Tennessee as the floodwaters rose around the facility: Per the Today article, Helene has reportedly caused billions of dollars in damage and economic loss. More video footage shows the major destruction as first responders rescued people from what the storm left behind: Tennessee is now on the list of states “under declarations of emergency,” making it eligible for federal funds to aid in recovery, Reuters said.",

    "title": "Exclusive — Marsha Blackburn Says Immigration Failures Lay Squarely on Harris: Brought in Millions",
    "author": "Hannah Knudsen",
    "content": "Vice President Kamala Harris owns the immigration failures in the country — from the millions of migrants coming in to the entry of Chinese nationals and terrorists — Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) said during an appearance on Breitbart News Saturday. Host and Breitbart News Washington Bureau Chief Matthew Boyle brought up some of the latest border figures, which estimated that there are 425,431 convicted criminals inside America right now who are not from this country — “13,000 convicted of homicide, more than 15,000 close to 16,000 convicted of sexual assault,” Boyle pointed out. “These are just astounding statistics,” he said in light of Harris’s trip to the border on Friday: “Her comments were insulting to the American people,” Blackburn said of Harris. “And does she honestly think people are so stupid that they do not realize she’s the current vice president, and if she wanted to do this, she has said, and Joe Biden has said, she was the last person in the room on every decision?” “I want people to think about this because right off the bat, Joe Biden did 94 executive orders in the first 100 days that made it easier to make illegal immigration legal. They opened up that border,” Blackburn said, walking through the shocking figures as a result of those decisions. “They have brought in ten and a half million people. They have brought in over 350 known terrorists. They have allowed tens of thousands of Chinese nationals to come in over here, and that is, you know, you don’t get out of China unless the CCP gives you that get out of China free card,” the senator said. LISTEN: “And Kamala Harris has stood at the microphone over and over and said, ‘The border is secure.’ Talking to people like you, crazy people, why don’t you look at this border? Don’t you know it’s secure, and they can see with their own eye the groups of migrants that are coming to that border. They live it in their communities, with migrants being placed into your community, with crime, with gangs, with drugs, with death from fentanyl,” Blackburn continued, emphasizing that Americans know the reality because they are living it. “They know this issue more fully than she knows this issue, and it is insulting to the American people for her to stand at that border and make such a statement and wait until the border has become a top issue in the campaign to even show her case right at the border’s edge. She made one trip at El Paso, but she has not worked with the Border Patrol,” Blackburn added.

    "title": "Exclusive — Marsha Blackburn: ‘Union Bosses Do Not Have Control’ over Whom Union Members Support",
    "author": "Hannah Knudsen",
    "content": "Union bosses “do not have control” over whom union members support, Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), who held a town hall event with auto workers in Michigan Friday, said during an appearance on Breitbart News Saturday. “Another thing that came up during the Town Hall, which I thought was also fascinating, was, of course, we saw the UAW president, Sean Fain, speak at the Democrat National Convention. He’s a partisan Democrat, right?” host Matthew Boyle said, reminding everyone that the place booed for Fain. “What it shows you is that the union bosses do not have control over what those union members think, say, and support,” Blackburn said, just one day after speaking with many of these auto workers alongside former President Donald Trump. Blackburn said the stark reality is that all of these issues — the economy, the border, etc. — affect the jobs of these auto workers, and they know who has their back on these issues. “And these guys, like we said earlier, it is the impact of what is happening with inflation, with immigration, with the fentanyl crisis, with crime in the communities, with Kamala Harris being for gun confiscation. And people are looking at that and saying, ‘Wait a minute. This is far west lefty,’ and she is, and I know you remember the in 2019, when I was ranked the most conservative member of the U.S. Senate. Kamala Harris was my polar opposite. She was ranked the most liberal member of the U.S. Senate,” Blackburn said, emphasizing that these auto workers “wanted to talk” during the town hall on Friday. “There was a mom that talked about being a single mom — she has five children — and just how hard it is to afford life, and she was so cute and so nervous and could hardly speak. She said, you know, she had not been a fan of President Trump, and then she realized her son said, ‘I want you to really get started looking at what he’s talking about.’ So she did, and then she became an avid Trump supporter. She voted for him in 2020 and is voting for him again this year,” Blackburn said. “The issues they talked about — the economy, immigration, the open border, inflation — those issues that are affecting their jobs and their productivity. And then they related it to how it affects their ability to manufacture, how it affects their ability to actually continue to do their work and manufacture here in the U.S.,” she added.
