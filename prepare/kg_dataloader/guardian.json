    "content": "Singer and rapper Aaron Carter accidentally drowned in his bathtub due to sedatives he’d taken and gas used in spray cleaners he had inhaled, according to a coroner’s report released on Tuesday. Carter was found submerged and dead at age 34 in the bathtub of his home in Lancaster, California, on 5 November, the autopsy report from the Los Angeles county medical examiner-coroner said. The sedative alprazolam, often sold under the brand name Xanax, was found in his system, as was difluoroethane, which the report says is “a gas commonly used as a propellant in air spray cleaners”, which “can induce feelings of euphoria when inhaled”. Related: Aaron Carter was the millennium’s bubblegum bad boy – and the victim of a rapacious music industry The two substances incapacitated him in the tub, and caused the drowning, the report said. The autopsy was performed the day after Carter’s death, but the results were withheld for toxicology tests, which often take months. Carter, the younger brother of the Backstreet Boys’ Nick Carter, was a former child star and global pop sensation whose greatest hits included I Want Candy, Aaron’s Party (Come Get It) and That’s How I Beat Shaq. Carter supported the Backstreet Boys on tour and had a successful solo career, releasing his debut album at age nine. His second album, Aaron’s Party (Come Get It), was released in 2000 and went triple platinum. The former child star’s relationship with his family grew strained later in life; he filed for bankruptcy in 2013, and enrolled in rehab several times. The Associated Press contributed reporting",

    "title": "‘Tentacles everywhere’: Victorian ministerial adviser improperly influenced $1.2m union contract, Ibac finds",
    "author": "Benita Kolovos",
    "content": "An anti-corruption investigation has found a Victorian government adviser “improperly influenced” the awarding of a $1.2m contract to a union, with a former minister telling investigators that staff in Daniel Andrews’ office had “tentacles everywhere”. Jenny Mikakos, the health minister from 2018 to 2020, was one of several witnesses interviewed by the Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission as part its investigation into the awarding of the contract to the Health Workers Union. The investigation, dubbed Operation Daintree, does not make any findings of corruption against Andrews, Mikakos, her predecessor, Jill Hennessy, or staff working in their offices. Related: Victoria budget expected to slash spending on infrastructure, public service and health But its final report, tabled in parliament on Wednesday, lays bare the “increasing influence of ministerial advisers and the centralisation of power in the PPO” – the premier’s private office. “Around the world, commentators have observed a growing politicisation of public administration through the enlargement of political executives’ roles, political appointments at senior administrative levels, partisanship in promotions and the increased use of ministerial advisors,” the Ibac report reads. “In Ibac’s view, Victoria has not been immune from this trend. “Accompanying this trend has been a tolerance, or, on occasion, tacit encouragement of rule avoidance, bending and breaking.” In her evidence to Ibac, Mikakos described the government as “very centralised with the PPO having its tentacles everywhere”. She said there was “constant tension between ministerial offices and the PPO” and described her handover with Hennessy, health minister from 2014 to 2018, as “principally focused on how interventionist the PPO and premier had been in the health portfolio”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup According to Ibac’s findings, the HWU and its secretary, Diana Asmar, began lobbying for a publicly funded training program in hospitals to deal with violence in 2018. Ibac said Asmar had initially lobbied a senior adviser in the PPO before moving on to a senior adviser to the health minister – neither of whom have been identified by the commission. The health minister’s adviser helped develop an “unsolicited proposal” for an HWU entity, the Health Education Federation, to deliver training for 575 workers. It was then submitted by the adviser to the Department of Health and Human Services, which Ibac said had “significant concerns” about HEF’s capacity to deliver the program and the lack of a competitive tender process. Ibac said that, during the three-month procurement process, the health minister’s adviser had contacted DHHS staff on several occasions, including to ask “why it was taking so long”. Just hours before the government went into caretaker period on 30 October 2018 in the lead-up to a state election, the DHHS entered into the $1.2m contract with HEF, including an upfront payment of $121,500, requested by Asmar via the adviser, according to Ibac. Ibac’s investigation found the adviser “improperly influenced” and “intruded into the process of DHHS awarding the contract to the HEF”. “The decision by DHHS to contract with HEF without undertaking a competitive procurement process was driven by a belief of senior staff in that department that that was the minister’s and government’s preference, and by ongoing pressure from the ministerial advisor and secretary of the union,” the report reads. Ibac made no findings of wrongdoing against Asmar, accepting “in part” that neither she nor the union were familiar with DHHS’s procurement procedures. In total, $335,000 of the contract was paid to HEF. According to Ibac, the quality of the training was poor. But another adviser in the new health minister’s office, on occasion at the request of a senior adviser in the PPO, “dissuaded DHHS from taking steps to terminate the contract” in 2019 and 2020. Ibac also examined a $2.2m election commitment made by the premier and Hennessy on 23 October 2018 to train 1,000 frontline health workers in partnership with the HWU. Asmar stood alongside them at the press conference and understood the announcement to mean that HEF would deliver the training, Ibac said. Mikakos, however, decided to go through a competitive procurement process, telling Ibac “things had not been going well with the other contract”. She told Ibac that Asmar had “complained to the premier’s office that other unions were receiving significant election commitments and she felt her union hadn’t”. “[Staff] would move heaven and earth to keep the union movement happy … You just need to look at all of our EBA outcomes,” Mikakos told the inquiry. Andrews contested this in his evidence, saying the HWU’s influence on “the political fortunes of [his] government was miniscule [sic]” and denied knowledge of his adviser’s role in the saga. Hennessy and Mikakos told Ibac they were not aware of the circumstances surrounding the HWU’s successful application for funding. Hennessy did not contest the 2022 state election, while Mikakos resigned in September 2020 in the wake of the government’s hotel quarantine scandal . Ibac made 17 recommendations, including allowing advisers to be called before parliamentary committees to make their roles more transparent. A separate investigation by the Victorian ombudsman into the politicisation of the public service is also under way.",

    "title": "Russian hackers want to ‘disrupt or destroy’ UK infrastructure, minister warns",
    "author": "Dan Sabbagh Defence and security editor",
    "content": "Russian hackers organised along the lines of the paramilitary Wagner group are seeking “to disrupt or destroy” parts of the UK’s critical national infrastructure, a cabinet minister will warn at a cyber conference in Belfast on Wednesday. Oliver Dowden, the Cabinet Office minister, will issue a national alert to key businesses amid growing international concern that as Russia struggles in Ukraine, an under-pressure Kremlin is searching for new ways to threaten the west. US intelligence that leaked earlier this month warned that Russian hackers had claimed to have taken over control systems belonging to a Canadian gas pipeline at the end of February, with the aim of causing an explosion. Dowden is expected to tell the Cyber UK event that disclosing the threat is “not something we do lightly”. He will argue it is necessary to get companies in utilities and other critical sectors to realise they have to invest as needed in cybersecurity “to defend themselves and the country”. He will describe the adversaries as “ideologically motivated, rather than financially motivated”, adding that they are less likely to show the same level of restraint as those directly employed by a nation state, making the situation “particularly concerning”. A top-secret intelligence snippet in the Pentagon files that leaked earlier this month warned that a Russian cybercriminal group called Zarya had claimed to have taken over the control systems of the unnamed pipeline. The hackers then asked the country’s FSB spy agency for instructions on what to do next. The hackers “shared screenshots” with the FSB “alleging capability to increase valve pressure, disable alarms and initiate an emergency shutdown of an unspecified gas distribution station”, according to the report, based on electronic eavesdropping of communications between the two sides. However, there is no corroborating evidence in the public domain that a natural-gas pipeline company in Canada suffered the hacker attack described or that any explosion took place. The intelligence may also have helped prevent the attack, although it was labelled as being for US eyes only. Royal Mail was targeted by Russian criminal hackers earlier this year, with the LockBit group demanding an $80m ransom , after the attackers had encrypted files crucial to the company’s international operations. It rejected the demands as “absurd” according to a transcript of the negotiations leaked by the hackers online. Dowden did not name any of the hacker groups, but the reference to Wagner, the large paramilitary group that is playing an important role on the ground in Ukraine, suggests the UK believes efforts are being made to organise the criminal groups of hackers into something more permanent. Critical national infrastructure covers areas such as gas, electricity, telecoms and postal networks as well as the emergency services and other organisations on which daily life relies. Serious attacks remain rare, but in the US, an oil pipeline on the east coast briefly shut down its operations two years ago after it was hacked by an online extortion gang, leading to shortages of petrol and jet fuel. Russian hackers have also targeted Ukrainian utilities, both before and since last year’s full invasion. Ukraine has been able to maintain supplies with the help of the west, although some of the cyber-attacks last autumn were conducted in tandem with missile strikes aimed at power and substations on its energy grid.",

    "title": "Private landlords in England get £1.6bn a year welfare for ‘non-decent’ homes",
    "author": "Robert Booth  Social affairs correspondent",
    "content": "Private landlords in England are earning £1.6bn a year in housing benefit in return for providing “non-decent” homes, in what Sadiq Khan has described as a scandal. The capital is the worst affected region, with £500m in welfare money going on privately rented homes that are in a state of disrepair, cold, damp, lacking modern facilities or do not meet health and safety standards, according to City Hall analysis. More than quarter of a billion pounds in welfare is also being spent annually on non-decent homes in the north-west and £173m in the east of England. An additional £7.3bn is being paid in annual rent by tenants to private landlords for non-decent homes. Renters described the estimated spending as “an outrage” and Khan, the mayor of London, is stepping up calls for the government to introduce the reforms to the private rented sector it first promised in its 2019 election manifesto. Five million households rent from private landlords in England and Wales – up 28% in a decade, the 2021 census showed. “It’s just a money-making scheme,” said Sylla, a mother of three children whose £1,800-a-month rent in east London is paid entirely by housing benefit, despite the private landlord failing to fix persistent problems with broken heating, leaks and a faulty toilet. “They really don’t care about your wellbeing.” The figures came amid fresh concerns about overcrowding. The National Housing Federation said 310,000 children in England were forced to share a bed with parents or siblings and one in every six children – 1.9 million – lived in cramped conditions. Parents in an estimated 180,000 families were having to sleep in the living room, bathroom, hallway or kitchen. Michael Gove, the secretary of state for levelling up, housing and communities, last year announced plans for a renters reform bill that would “slash” the amount of housing benefit spent with landlords renting out non-decent homes and ban “no fault” evictions, but the bill has been delayed. “It is a scandal that some private landlords are profiting from letting sub-standard housing that is unfit for 21st-century living,” said Khan. “Renters would feel more secure raising complaints about the condition of their property if they didn’t face the threat of arbitrary eviction … The government should also give me the power to drive up standards and introduce a rent freeze in London.” The London Renters Union said housing benefit had become “a free handout to private landlords, and public money would be better spent increasing the stock of social homes”. Ben Beadle, the chief executive of the National Residential Landlords Association, responded by calling on councils to use existing laws “to enforce the powers they already have to tackle the minority of sub-standard homes in the rental market”. He said Khan’s desired rent freeze would “drive responsible landlords out of the market … and leave them at the mercy of rogue and criminal landlords”. But the Generation Rent campaign group called for tougher penalties for landlords of unsafe homes and said “increasing reliance on the private sector to provide housing has resulted in a higher bill for the public purse with nothing to show for it but poorer living standards.” A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: “Councils should use the powers we’ve given them to crack down on rogue landlords, including issuing fines of up to £30,000 and banning those who rent out unsafe homes.” They said the government planned to “fundamentally reform the sector and level up housing quality in this country”, including by introducing the first legally binding decent homes standard for private rent. They added: “Evidence shows rent controls in the private sector do not work, leading to declining standards and a lack of investment and may encourage illegal subletting.”",

    "author": "Jacob Steinberg at Stamford Bridge",
    "content": "Didier Drogba has launched a stinging attack on Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital, accusing Chelsea’s owners of lacking class and claiming that the club has become unrecognisable since being sold last year by Roman Abramovich. \n Drogba, who scored Chelsea’s winning penalty in the Champions League final against Bayern Munich in 2012, made his displeasure clear before Frank Lampard’s side were knocked out of the Champions League by a 2-0 defeat against Real Madrid on Tuesday night. \n \n Related: Chelsea 0-2 Real Madrid (agg 0-4): Champions League player ratings \n \n The legendary former striker was working on the game as a pundit for Canal+ and his comments on the changing face of the club are likely to have been in reference to more not being done to keep key figures from the previous regime at Stamford Bridge. \n “I knew this club with a certain class during the Abramovich era, but today I find it lacking,” Drogba said. “It’s very hard for me to see how they got rid of certain people. They should go back to the principles and values they had. I no longer recognise my club.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Chelsea went in a new direction following Abramovich’s departure, with Bruce Buck, Marina Granovskaia, Petr Cech and other influential personnel leaving the club last summer. Lampard, who has lost his first four games since being placed in temporary charge this month, refused to respond to Drogba’s remarks. \n Chelsea saw the buildup to the second leg of their quarter-final against Madrid dominated by the focus on Boehly telling the players that the season has been “embarrassing ” after last Saturday’s defeat to Brighton & Hove Albion. Boehly and his fellow co-owner, Behdad Eghbali, entered the dressing room again after two goals from Rodrygo gave Madrid 4-0 victory on aggregate. \n \n Related: Chelsea show distorting effect of money without sense or love \n \n Going out of the Champions League means that Chelsea, who are unlikely to qualify for Europe, have little but pride to play for this season. But Lampard, who thought Éder Militão was lucky not to be sent off, insisted they will bounce back. He urged his side to finish the campaign on a high. \n “We can set the building blocks now of where we want to get to,” he said. “I’ve come into that. Can I affect it in that period? Hopefully. We want to get back to where we were. But everyone’s doing the same, everyone’s invested, everyone’s getting better. Maybe some clubs are more stable than we are in terms of the squad. I don’t think we can get ahead of ourselves.”",

    "title": "Keir Starmer says NHS is ‘broken’ and in jeopardy under Tories",
    "author": "Nadeem Badshah",
    "content": "Keir Starmer has said the NHS is “broken” and he believes the future of the health service is in jeopardy under the Conservatives. The Labour leader accused the Tories of presiding over a “cycle of decline” as new research by his party shows that nearly a fifth of patients in England, which equates to 4.5 million people, went to A&E last year because they were unable to get a GP appointment . He also said Rishi Sunak was “sitting on his hands” with the impending threat of further industrial action from junior doctors and nurses in their dispute with the government. Starmer said he saw “no political advantage” from the strikes and was fearful about the risks to patient safety from more walkouts in an interview with the Daily Telegraph. On Monday, it emerged that at least 196,000 procedures and hospital appointments in England had to be rescheduled due to the four-day junior doctors strike last week. He said: “I think the NHS is broken. There’s been one way of doing things for the last 13 years, and this is where we’ve ended up now with the NHS. “If they carry on like this, it can’t survive – the biggest risk to the NHS is another Tory government.” Labour said its research on A&E data showed the “collapse of general practice” and poor use of taxpayers’ money with emergency hospital visits costing the NHS up to nine times as much as a GP appointment. The findings are based on polling of 1,500 adults carried out by Redfield and Wilton Strategies, which found that 18% of patients attending A&E did so because they could not get a GP appointment in time. Starmer, the MP for the London constituency of Holborn and St Pancras, believes a sustainable future blueprint for the NHS is neighbourhood health services tailored to local communities instead of a centralised system. On Friday Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, will outline plans to reform GP services through local health services. Separate research by Labour found that one person who called 999 for an ambulance was forced to wait for an hour-and-a-half before their call was answered. Labour sent freedom of information requests to all 10 ambulance trusts in England to find out the longest ambulance response time in December. The longest 999 response in December was in Yorkshire, where a caller waited for an hour and 37 minutes. The party also asked for the longest 111 response time in December, which was three hours and five minutes for a caller in the Midlands. Streeting said: “After 13 years of Conservative mismanagement of the NHS, patients can no longer be sure their 999 call will be answered or that an ambulance will arrive when they need one. “People are just praying they don’t fall ill or suffer an accident. Labour will launch the biggest expansion of NHS staff training in history, paid for by abolishing non-doms, so that the NHS is there for us when we need it once again.”",

    "author": "Richard Luscombe",
    "content": "A sheriff and several officials of a rural Oklahoma county are under pressure to resign after a local newspaper recorded their racist and expletive-laden conversation about their desire to murder journalists and lynch Black citizens. Related: ‘Buckets of tears’: mother of Black teen shot after going to wrong address speaks Dozens of residents of McCurtain county protested at the sheriff’s office in Idabel on Monday, echoing calls from the Oklahoma governor, Kevin Stitt, and the city’s mayor, Craig Young, for the officials to step down. In the recording, captured after a county commission meeting in March, and released by the McCurtain Gazette , Sheriff Kevin Clardy is heard discussing with commissioner Mark Jennings, investigator Alicia Manning and jail administrator Larry Hendrix the hiring of “mafia hitmen” one of them claimed to know to kill the newspaper’s owners and journalists. The hitmen would, according to Jennings, “cut no fucking mercy” while Clardy offered the use of his excavator to dig graves. But it was the group’s deeply racist commentary that angered protesters the most. Jennings cited a former county sheriff from the 1980s in a discussion about running for the office. “If it was back in the day, when Alan Marston would take a damn Black guy and whoop their ass and throw him in the cell, I’d run for fucking sheriff,” he said on the recording. “Yeah, it’s not like that no more,” Clardy lamented, before Jennings continued: “Take them down to Mud Creek and hang them up with a damn rope. But you can’t do that any more. They got more rights than we got.” In another snippet, the group is heard mocking a woman who died in a fire – the sheriff likened her corpse to barbecued meat. Stitt issued a statement demanding the “immediate resignation” of the four. “I am both appalled and disheartened to hear of the horrid comments made by officials in McCurtain county,” Stitt said. “There is simply no place for such hateful rhetoric in the state of Oklahoma, especially by those that serve to represent the community through their respective office. I will not stand idly by while this takes place.” Stitt added he had ordered the state bureau of investigation to determine “whether any illegal conduct has occurred”. The recording was made by the Gazette after a commission meeting in Idabel in March. According to NBC News , the outlet suspected that officials were illegally conducting county business outside a public meeting and left an active recording device in the council chamber. In a statement to NBC, Kilpatrick Townsend, the law firm representing the Willingham family that owns the Gazette, said its clients had previously been targeted by county officials who disliked its reporting. “For nearly a year, they have suffered intimidation, ridicule and harassment based solely on their efforts to report the news for McCurtain county,” the statement said. Clardy, Manning and Hendrix were reportedly suspended from the Oklahoma Sheriffs’ Association on Tuesday, according to a statement given to local media. The McCurtain county sheriff’s office, meanwhile, promised its own criminal investigation into how the recording was made and released. A statement posted to Facebook by the department alleges “multiple, significant violations” of an Oklahoma state communications law and threatens felony charges “for those involved”. “Many of these recordings, like the one published by media outlets on Friday, have yet to be duly authenticated or validated. Our preliminary information indicates that the media released audio recording has, in fact, been altered. The motivation for doing so remains unclear at this point,” it said. “In addition to being illegally obtained, the audio does not match the ‘transcription’ of that audio and is not precisely consistent with what has been put into print.” The sheriff’s office also said death threats had been made to county officials and their families, and claimed “multiple agencies” were assisting its investigation.",

    "content": "Well, there goes the season. Perhaps summer budget too. Who knows maybe the entire Chelsea 3.0 Blue Sky Project Stage One? \n With 28 minutes to go in a Champions League second leg Chelsea always seemed to be losing, even when they were threatening vaguely to win it, the home bench took a deep breath, cleared its throat, and coughed up £260m of randomly assembled attacking talent. \n Admittedly Chelsea were 3-0 down in the tie by the time Raheem Sterling, João Félix and Mykhaylo Mudryk came on to the pitch, having spent an hour playing with five defenders and three defensive midfielders, one of them installed as an assiduous and energetic No 10-cum-right-winger. \n \n Related: Real Madrid’s Rodrygo floors Chelsea to seal Champions League semi-final spot \n \n And yes, by that point this thrillingly overmanned attacking machine had mustered a single goal in its last 510 minutes of football. But hey: Boehly-ball. Go with it. Disrupt. Subvert the dominant paradigm. Storm the dressing room. Anything to keep away the gathering sense of quiet horror around this whole grand, baffling, viciously wasteful football-style project. \n This was a strange football match. There is something sad, but also grotesque about seeing this Chelsea team toiling through their patterns, all mangled shapes and blocked talent. Nothing here feels permanent or stitched together, or put in place with any skill or love. We are the hollow men. We are the stuffed men. We are the human spoils of Todd Boehly’s incoherent acquisitiveness, the top down confusion as to how this complex and heavily ritualised sport actually works. \n For all that Chelsea did also play well here. Stamford Bridge was boisterously full, those low white midweek lights conjuring the muscle memory of more coherent times, of teams that looked like teams, of some guiding intelligence behind this 25-year project team. There were key missed chances before Madrid took the lead. The ball kept falling to N’Golo Kanté close to goal, but then this will happen if you select N’Golo Kanté to play close to goal. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Frank Lampard had picked a team to snipe and harry and chase, with Conor Gallagher and Kanté as his dogs of counter-pressing. And it worked for a bit. Chelsea did snap and chase and force some hurried clearances, producing 45 minutes of angry, chastened, slightly vague attacking pressure. Things happened but didn’t happen. Chelsea almost made chances. Reece James had an excellent game after the chasing in Madrid. Chelsea have many problems. James really isn’t one of them. Just before half-time Marc Cucurella allowed Thibaut Courtois to produce a world-class save, waiting just a little too long in front of goal. \n Still, though it felt a little bit desperate measures, an attempt to throw a shape over something shapeless. By the end Chelsea had launched 28 crosses into the Madrid box, which really is a lot of crosses. Is this the right way to do this thing? Maybe. Who knows. What does Todd think? \n Madrid just had to be good enough here. They took the lead through Rodrygo, set up by a lovely little pass from Vinícius Júnior. Rodrygo also walked the second goal into the net to make it 4-0 on aggregate. Kepa Arrizabalaga launched a wild, swinging leg as he lingered on the line. It felt a little insolent. But can you blame Madrid for that? This wasn’t so much men against boys as a highly competent team against a hallucinogenic fever dream of how to do soccer, winched into place by a coterie of hyped up management consultants. \n Something a little grotesque has been created here, a real-time reminder of the things people want to do to this sport, of the distorting effects of money without sense or love or care. Even the half-time warmup was an excruciating spectacle as Chelsea’s star substitutes bumbled about in their padded coats bantering with Antonio Rüdiger, swaggering vaguely, conveying a sense of total alienation. There may have been more contemptuously disinterested knee lunges than those performed by Hakim Ziyech on the Stamford Bridge pitch. But not many. And none that spring to mind. \n And so Chelsea’s season has pretty much reached an end point. Perhaps the promise of a Europa Conference League place might fire the synapses. More like this entity is heading for some more public contortions. The air is starting to hum a little. And pretty soon nobody around here will have much to lose. \n \n Related: Didier Drogba: ‘Chelsea now lacks class … I don’t recognise the club’ \n \n What happens to this club from here? There is no way of clawing back the stupid amounts of money spent. Income will now take a dive. What do you do to recoup those investment funds? Capsize the Premier League and start a money harvesting super league? Or cut your losses and move on to hydrogen batteries or olive oil or lithium mining? \n Right now this place is starting to resemble a footballing version of the Raft of the Medusa, a sinking vessel peopled by castaways, hanging on not out of love or duty but self preservation. Who is really looking out for this thing anyway, the delicate, patchwork entity that is Chelsea FC. The club’s third manager in the last eight months is basically a sole trader, expert, if nothing else in self-preservation. The players have their own brands and auras and future worth to protect. \n The season may be dead on its feet, a lesson in nothing more than how to turn human talent into cold product. But there is still a sense of unresolved energy about this toxic escapade. The next few weeks might just make for interesting viewing.",

    "content": "10.57pm BST Recap Dominion Voting Systems reached a settlement in its $1.6bn defamation lawsuit against Fox . “The truth matters. Lies have consequences,” said Dominion lawyer Justin Nelson, noting that the $787.5m settlement with Fox represents accountability. However, Fox News hosts are not expected to retract or acknowledge the falsehoods they spread about Dominion on air. Senate Republicans have shown no inclination in helping Democrats replace the ailing senator Dianne Feinstein on the judiciary committee. Joe Biden spoke last night with Ralph Yarl , the Black teenager shot after ringing the doorbell at the wrong house in Kansas City, Missouri. Meanwhile, police arrested the alleged shooter after protests over the attack. Anti-abortion groups have filed their response before the supreme court, which is considering whether to uphold a Texas judge’s ruling taking the abortion drug mifepristone off shelves nationwide. Updated at 11.01pm BST 10.52pm BST Representative Cori Bush has joined in calls for for supreme court justice Clarence Thomas to be impeached, following reports that the he did not disclose his financial dealings with Republican donor and real estate developer Harlan Crow. Bush said: It is clear that Justice Thomas holds a complete disregard for law and ethics that is incompatible with the trust and confidence placed in federal judges. For these reasons, and because the federal judiciary has failed to hold Justice Thomas accountable, I am calling for impeachment proceedings to begin regarding Justice Thomas’s apparent violations of federal law. Holding judges accountable for their behavior is a matter of life-or-death for our communities. They wield enormous power, and the current hands-off approach to the judiciary has only emboldened lawless, corrupt, far-right judges to strip away our rights and make our lives worse off. Updated at 10.55pm BST 10.17pm BST Fox won’t have to acknowledge that it lied about Dominion on air , according to CNN media reporter Oliver Darcy. Although Fox acknowledged, in a circuitous statement, “the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false”, Fox News hosts won’t have to admit to lying to its viewers, or directly take accountability for spreading false information. News: I'm told that, as part of the terms of its settlement, Fox News will *not* have to acknowledge ON AIR that it told lies about Dominion in the wake of the 2020 election. Fox did acknowledge falsehoods in its statement. But don't expect hosts to have to read statements. — Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) April 18, 2023 Updated at 10.21pm BST 10.07pm BST Reuters reports that Fox shareholders are seeking records to review executives’ oversight of Fox News’ coverage of Donald Trump’s election claims. From Reuters: Fox Corp shareholders are demanding company records that may show whether directors and executives properly oversaw Fox News’ coverage of former President Donald Trump’s election-rigging claims, sources told Reuters, in what could be a prelude to lawsuits seeking to make directors liable for costs. Investors are using provisions in Delaware corporate law to demand internal Fox records to investigate how Fox’s leaders acted as its Fox News network aired segments on Trump’s false claims that he lost the 2020 presidential election due to voter fraud, two sources confirmed. In moves not previously reported, shareholders are looking for records such as board minutes, emails and texts that may contain evidence that Fox directors and executives were derelict by allowing the network to air the false claims. Updated at 10.10pm BST 9.56pm BST And here’s a longer statement from John Poulos, Dominion’s CEO: Fox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion that caused enormous damage to my company, our employees, and our customers. Nothing can ever make up for that. Throughout this process, we have sought accountability, and believe the evidence brought to light through this case underscores the consequences of spreading and endorsing lies. Truthful reporting in the media is essential to our democracy. Dominion, our employees and our partners are grateful to the court for allowing the process for the truth to come out. Updated at 9.58pm BST 9.46pm BST In a statement addressing the settlement, Fox News acknowledged the falsehoods aired on the network, without going much further to take accountability. The statement reads: We are pleased to have reached a settlement of our dispute with Dominion Voting Systems. We acknowledge the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false. This settlement reflects FOX’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards. We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.

What the Dominion trial offered was a keyhole view into the day-to-day industrial-scale deceit that takes place at Fox. It helped illustrate why the company is such a uniquely destructive force.” Updated at 9.28pm BST 9.03pm BST The settlement in Dominion Voting Systems’s defamation lawsuit against Fox News came just as opening arguments were to begin in the trial, which was being held in Wilmington, Delaware. A jury had been seated earlier today, and opening arguments were expected this afternoon, before being delayed without explanation – until now. Dominion was seeking $1.6bn in compensation from Fox, alleging the broadcaster knowingly defamed it with reports that baselessly claimed the elections firm rigged the 2020 election against Donald Trump . 8.59pm BST Dominion Voting Systems settles defamation case against Fox News Dominion Voting Systems has reached a settlement in its $1.6bn defamation lawsuit against Fox News, the Guardian has confirmed. We will post more details as they come in. Updated at 9.05pm BST 8.46pm BST Biden condemns McCarthy's debt ceiling strategy Speaking at the White House earlier today, Joe Biden cast Republican House speaker Kevin McCarthy ’s rhetoric on the debt ceiling as irresponsible. Here’s a clip of his comments: President Biden calls out Speaker Kevin McCarthy over the debt ceiling: “He proposed huge cuts to important programs that millions of Americans count on … He threatened to become the first Speaker to default on our national debt … What are MAGA Republicans in Congress doing?” pic.twitter.com/yzIyqf5BsR — The Recount (@therecount) April 18, 2023 The two men are at loggerheads over the issue, which could pose a grievous threat to the health of the world’s largest economy. Biden wants to increase the borrowing limit without preconditions, while McCarthy wants the president and his Democratic allies to agree to spending cuts, arguing that the country’s budget deficit is out of control. Meanwhile, White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates condemned rightwing House Republicans who want to see the Inflation Reduction Act dismantled. Here’s a statement he shared with the Guardian: By targeting the Inflation Reduction Act, Scott Perry and Chip Roy just showed the real agenda of the ultra MAGA hardliners who increasingly dominate the House Republican Conference. Not only are House Republicans threatening to hold Americans’ jobs and retirement savings hostage by engaging in the dangerous brinkmanship that Presidents Reagan and Trump warned against. Now, the increasingly empowered extreme MAGA Republicans want their ransom to be killing tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs in a windfall for China, raising prescription drug and energy costs for middle class families, and sending the deficit skyward – all in the name of sweetheart deals for rich special interests. That’s on top of a multitude of other tax handouts they’re seeking for big corporations and the wealthy. Like even Donald Trump said in 2019, avoiding a catastrophic and unprecedented default is non-negotiable. And threatening default to sell working people out to Big Pharma and billionaires is incredibly revealing.” 8.26pm BST Judge orders special master to investigate alleged Fox withholding of evidence The judge in Dominion Voting Systems’s lawsuit against Fox News has appointed a special master to ensure Fox News turned over all evidence in the case, the Washington Post reports: News: The judge has formally tasked the special master in the Fox/Dominion case with launching an investigation that \"should include a determination whether Fox News Network ... complied with their discovery allegations\" A report is due to the judge by May 15 — Jeremy Barr (@jeremymbarr) April 18, 2023 Here is the back-story: https://t.co/XO2GeF3HZp It's worth noting that the judge has said he is satisfied with the issue regarding Rupert Murdoch's title, though Dominion has claimed that Fox did not properly turn over materials including secret recordings of Maria Bartiromo. — Jeremy Barr (@jeremymbarr) April 18, 2023 Jury selection in the case concluded earlier today, and opening arguments were expected to begin afterward, but have been delayed without explanation. Dominion is seeking $1.6bn in compensation from Fox, arguing the conservative network harmed its business by falsely told its viewers the company was involved in rigging the 2020 election. 8.17pm BST It seems unlikely we’ll hear full opening arguments this afternoon, if we hear anything at all. There has been an unexplained delay since lunch. Both sides earlier told Judge Eric Davis they had planned more than an hour opening arguments and court is scheduled to end today at 4.30pm. The trial had already been pushed back a day. Updated at 8.34pm BST 7.59pm BST The outlines of what rightwing House Republicans want in exchange for increasing the debt ceiling are becoming clear. CNN reports that Scott Perry , leader of the Freedom Caucus that includes some of the House’s most conservative lawmakers, wants to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act – Joe Biden ’s signature legislative achievement that also includes the strongest measures Congress has ever enacted against climate change: Leaving a meeting in Speaker McCarthy’s office, Freedom Caucus Chairman Scott Perry warned that the House GOP’s debt ceiling plan, “if it’s gonna pass, it’s gonna have to” include a repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act. — Melanie Zanona (@MZanona) April 18, 2023 7.40pm BST Fox-Dominion trial opening statements delayed Confusion is rampant in the packed courtroom, as opening statements were scheduled to start at 1.30pm after a lunch break, but still have not kicked off as of 2.40pm. Court staff said they could not explain the delay. Attorneys for Fox and Dominion appeared to huddle with each other at least once, and the judge and jurors have not been seated. Each party’s opening statement is supposed to last around 90 minutes. With a 4.30pm recess today, there is no longer time for both parties to preview their evidence. “As an update, I don’t have an update,” a court staffer said to the overflow room of journalists, resulting in many laughs. Updated at 7.57pm BST 7.25pm BST Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of the best known progressive Democrats in the House, has again condemned supreme court justice Clarence Thomas for his ties to a Republican mega donor. Thomas is a conservative stalwart on the court, but in recent days ProPublica revealed he had accepted luxury trips as well as a real estate deal from Harlan Crow , a deep-pocketed GOP supporter. Here’s what Ocasio-Cortez had to say about that: Rep. @AOC (D-NY) hits Clarence Thomas for not disclosing gifts and luxury trips from GOP donor Harlan Crow: \"The justice is required by law to disclose something like that ... If they want to live that kind of lifestyle, then they can resign from the court — they can retire.\" pic.twitter.com/SpdP1oVy2p — The Recount (@therecount) April 18, 2023 Senate Democrats have also demanded the supreme court investigate Thomas’s ties. Updated at 7.31pm BST 6.11pm BST The day so far We’re waiting for the opening arguments in the trial of Dominion Voting Systems’s defamation suit against Fox News, which is expected to start later this afternoon in Wilmington, Delaware, after the jury was seated this morning. Back in Washington, House Republicans are said to be nearing a vote on their proposal for raising the debt ceiling, but its chances of passage are uncertain. Here’s what else is happening today: Senate Republicans have shown no inclination in helping Democrats replace ailing senator Dianne Feinstein on the judiciary committee. Joe Biden spoke last night with Ralph Yarl , the Black teenager shot after ringing the doorbell at the wrong house in Kansas City. Meanwhile, police arrested the alleged shooter following protests over the attack. Anti-abortion groups have filed their response before the supreme court, which is considering whether to uphold a Texas judge’s ruling taking abortion drug mifepristone off shelves nationwide. Updated at 6.12pm BST 5.49pm BST Donald Trump’s finances could take another hit as the author E Jean Carroll’s civil suit alleging defamation heads to trial later this month. But the Guardian’s Hugo Lowell reports that Trump won’t appear on the witness stand when the proceedings begin: Trump is currently not expected to take the stand at E Jean Caroll defamation and battery trial scheduled to start April 25, per person familiar — Hugo Lowell (@hugolowell) April 18, 2023 Updated at 5.52pm BST 5.35pm BST While abortion foes try to get drugs used in the procedure off the shelves, the Guardian’s Poppy Noor spoke to a New York doctor about a technique that could be used to expand reproductive care access: Joan Fleischman has always had people flying in from across the world to her private abortion practice in Manhattan. In the two decades her clinic has been open, she has seen clients from places such as Ireland, the Bahamas and Mexico, who couldn’t get abortions in their home countries. In the past year, that has changed. Since the US federal right to abortion was overturned in June last year, she is now more likely to see patients flying in from her own country. Often they are from Texas, sometimes Ohio, or Florida. Some with links to the city, others with none. After years of providing abortion care, Fleischman, 60, still finds these trips shocking. “Usually, if somebody needs unusual medical care, they are willing to fly around the world for it – like for advanced neurosurgery or something. It’s always struck me as incredible that people are flying to me for the most simple procedure.” There’s a reason people fly to see Fleischman. She provides abortions through manual uterine aspiration – using a small, hand-held device to remove pregnancy tissue. The device is gentle enough that the tissue often comes out almost completely intact . It is a quick and discreet procedure where a patient might be in and out of the door in less than an hour. Related: ‘A gamechanger’: this simple device could help fight the war on abortion rights in the US 5.18pm BST The anti-abortion groups who convinced a federal judge to order mifepristone off the shelves have asked the supreme court to uphold the rulings, NBC News reports . The ruling earlier this month by conservative federal judge Matthew Kacsmaryk has been stayed temporarily by the supreme court while it reviews petitions from the Biden administration and a manufacturer of the abortion medication to allow its continued access. NBC News reports that the groups that originally brought a suit trying to revoke the Food and Drug Administration’s authorization of the pill have formally filed before the supreme court: The groups, led by the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, said in a filing that the court should leave in place a ruling last week by the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals that would suspend several regulatory decisions by the Food and Drug Administration since 2016 that made it easier to obtain the drug. Lawyers for the groups wrote that the FDA over decades has “stripped away every meaningful and necessary safeguard on chemical abortion, demonstrating callous disregard for women’s well-being, unborn life, and statutory limits”. They dismissed the government’s “sky-is-falling argument” about the implications of allowing the lower court ruling to go into effect. “The lower courts’ meticulous decisions do not second-guess the agency’s scientific determinations; they merely re- quire the agency to follow the law,” the lawyers wrote. Updated at 5.31pm BST 4.52pm BST House GOP debt limit vote could come next week: report House Republicans could as soon as next week vote on their proposal to raise the US government’s debt limit, while also cutting spending to a variety of Joe Biden ’s priorities, Punchbowl News reports . The US government has hit the legal limit on how much debt it can take on, and is expected to run out of money sometime in early June, which could cause it to default on its debt for the first time in history. That would have major negative ramifications for the economy, but the GOP lawmakers say they won’t support increasing the debt ceiling without concessions from Democrats, such as spending cuts. But House speaker Kevin McCarthy and his allies only control the chamber by a slim margin, and in a sign of how fraught the debt ceiling has become among Republicans, CNN reports at least one lawmaker won’t vote to increase the debt limit at all: Tim Burchett, a Tennessee Republican, says he’s still opposed to raising the debt limit, a sign of the challenges ahead for McCarthy to limit defections ahead of a possible vote next week. “I’m open to it but I’m still a no vote.” pic.twitter.com/4iGu9ZADul — Manu Raju (@mkraju) April 18, 2023 Democrats in the White House and Senate, meanwhile, say they will only support a “clean” debt ceiling increase that raises the limits without changes to spending. 4.32pm BST There was a brief hiccup in jury selection Tuesday morning in the closely watched Dominion v Fox defamation trial. After the twelve jurors were sworn in, one of the jurors stood up and said he couldn’t do it. The judge and lawyers from both sides spoke with him out of court and he was dismissed. Another juror was quickly sworn in. There were a few moments of levity in the packed Delaware courtroom. At one point, judge Eric Davis told jurors that he didn’t mind if they brought water or drinks in the court, as long as they had a lid. He quickly added “non-alcoholic”, prompting laughter. There was also some laughing as jurors had to slide past one another as they were called into the jury box then excused. Some jurors arrived, had to shimmy down a row past all the other jurors, only to shimmy out moments later when they were excused. Updated at 4.34pm BST 4.13pm BST Let’s shift to Washington politics for a minute to examine the bind Senate Democrats are in. They may control the chamber, but they’re having trouble confirming federal judges because of the absence of California senator Dianne Feinstein. The 89-year-old is a member of the judiciary committee, but has been out of Washington to receive treatment for shingles, delaying crucial votes to move nominees through committees. Last week, she asked to be temporarily replaced on the committee, but that would require the cooperation of at least some Republicans. In the clearest sign yet that the GOP won’t go along, their leader in the Senate Mitch McConnell today said he would oppose replacing her: Sen. Minority Leader Mitch McConnell argues against replacing Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) on Judiciary Committee, despite Feinstein requesting the removal herself: “The far left wants the full Senate to move a senator off a committee so they can ram through ... their nominees.” pic.twitter.com/ZGwjvKevYj — The Recount (@therecount) April 18, 2023 Updated at 4.17pm BST 3.56pm BST The Fox-Dominion defamation trial officially kicked off at 9 am in Delaware superior court and the 12 jurors who will determine whether Fox News acted with actual malice were seated roughly 90 minutes later. The jury appears to be comprised of seven Black and five white or non-Black people. A set of 12 alternates were also seated for what’s expected to be a six-week trial. The jury selection comes after Judge Eric Davis delayed the start of the trial by one day. Either the two sides could not reach an agreement on Monday, or speculation that settlement talks were underway was untrue. Opening arguments are set to begin after a short break. The judge and an attorney for Fox have already indicated that Dominion Voting Systems has numerous objections to Fox’s opening slides. Updated at 4.02pm BST 3.39pm BST The Fox-Dominion trial is now under way in Delaware, where CNBC reports the first witness will testify to his efforts to convince Fox that what they were broadcasting about the 2020 election was false: One of the first witnesses we could see on the Dominion side of the FOX defamation case as soon as today is Tony Fratto - now head of communications for Goldman Sachs who was an outside crisis communications consultant for Dominion in 2020. — Eamon Javers (@EamonJavers) April 18, 2023 He will testify about his real-time efforts in 2020 to convince Fox anchors and producers that the claims they were airing about Dominion were not true. That effort, clearly, was unsuccessful and led ultimately to the trial today. — Eamon Javers (@EamonJavers) April 18, 2023 3.14pm BST Florida governor Ron DeSantis is in Washington DC today, where he’s expected to meet with Republican members of Congress as he nears a potential run for president. That would escalate his clash with Donald Trump, who remains the strongest challenger for the presidency in the Republican party. Before he departed for the capital, the Guardian’s Richard Luscombe reports the governor made a new threat of retaliation against Disney for its criticism of his conservative policies: Ron DeSantis has unveiled the latest act of retaliation against Disney for speaking out against his “don’t say gay” law: he’s threatening to build a new state prison next to the company’s central Florida theme parks. The Republican governor dropped the suggestion at a hastily convened Monday lunchtime press conference, at which he laid out steps the state legislature would take to try to regain control over Florida’s largest private employer. The move is the latest in an ongoing feud that began in March 2022 when Disney’s then chief executive Bob Chapek spoke out against a bill limiting discussion of sexuality and gender identity in Florida elementary school classrooms, dubbed the “ don’t say gay ” law. Related: Ron DeSantis threatens prison near Disney theme park in latest retaliation 2.57pm BST Yesterday evening, Joe Biden called Ralph Yarl, the Black teen shot in Kansas City after ringing the doorbell at the wrong address, and “shared his hope for a swift recovery ”, according to the White House. Here’s more about the incident and the shooter’s arrest, from the Guardian’s Richard Luscombe and Sam Levin : A white homeowner in Kansas City, Missouri , has been charged with armed assault after he shot a Black teenager who rang his doorbell by mistake, authorities announced on Monday. Andrew Lester, 85, is also facing a charge of armed criminal action after shooting Ralph Yarl, 16, twice on Thursday. The teenager, a high school junior, was going to pick up his younger twin brothers from a play date when he went to the wrong address. Zachary Thompson, the prosecuting attorney, announced the charges late on Monday after intense local protests and widespread outrage over the police’s decision to briefly detain Lester before releasing him without charges. Related: Police charge white man for shooting Black teen boy who had wrong address Updated at 3.15pm BST 2.41pm BST The Fox-Dominion trial was supposed to start on Monday, but was unexpectedly delayed – fueling speculation that the two sides were nearing a settlement that would forgo a trial. That apparently didn’t pan out, but The Guardian’s Mark Sweney took a look at why settling might be in the conservative network’s interest: Rupert Murdoch’s push to try to bury a landmark defamation case against Fox News aims to avoid further damage to his media empire’s reputation – and protect the 92-year-old from a gruelling court appearance as he formulates succession plans. Judge Eric M Davis moved on Sunday to delay the start of the $1.6bn (£1.3bn) defamation trial between Fox Corporation and Dominion, which has alleged Fox News repeatedly broadcast false claims that its voting machines were rigged , amid reports of a settlement. However, the following day Davis confirmed the six-week trial would begin a day later than planned, with jury selection starting on Tuesday, after talks between the parties failed – for now at least. Related: ‘It avoids a public grilling’: why Murdoch could settle Dominion’s Fox News lawsuit 2.23pm BST The two most important words in the Fox-Dominion trial: 'actual malice' The defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News has already led to embarrassing revelations from inside the conservative network’s newsroom, including that some of its top stars “hate” Donald Trump and did not believe his claims that the 2020 election was stolen . But to get $1.6bn – or any sum – out of Fox for the harm it allegedly caused to its business, Dominion’s lawyers will have to prove the network acted with “actual malice” when it aired those falsehoods in the tense weeks following Joe Biden ’s election win. The Guardian’s Sam Levine is in Wilmington, Delaware, where the trial is opening today, and breaks it all down here. Have a read: The blockbuster $1.6bn defamation suit between Dominion Voting Systems and Fox is set to begin on Tuesday in a courtroom in Wilmington, Delaware , opening a six-week tribunal that represents one of the most muscular efforts to hold the powerful news network accountable for its role in spreading lies about the 2020 election. Dominion is suing Fox News and its parent company Fox Corporation for knowingly spreading false claims about its equipment after the 2020 election. Fox repeatedly broadcast outlandishly false allegations that the company had paid government bribes, switched votes and was founded in Venezuela to rig elections for Hugo Chávez. The trial was scheduled to begin on Monday, but Eric Davis, the Delaware superior court judge overseeing the case, pushed it back by a day without giving a reason. It was reported that both sides were engaged in negotiations over a settlement to avoid a trial. Jury selection will be completed on Tuesday, followed by opening arguments. The trial is likely to be a media frenzy. Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, the top Fox executives, are expected to be called as witnesses. Fox News anchors Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity , Maria Bartiromo and Jeanine Pirro are expected to testify at the trial. At the heart of Dominion’s case is a trove of internal messages from Fox hosts and executives in which they openly say they knew the outlandish claims about Dominion were false. “Sidney Powell is lying, by the way. I caught her. It’s insane,” Carlson wrote in one such message, even as Fox continued to air Powell’s claims about Dominion. “In the coming weeks, we will prove Fox spread lies causing enormous damage to Dominion. We look forward to trial,” a Dominion spokesperson said. Defamation cases rarely go to trial because there is such a high bar a plaintiff has to clear to win. But experts observing the lawsuit say Dominion has put together an unusually strong case. The company may have strong enough evidence to show that Fox acted with “actual malice”, that Fox knew the claims were false, or that Fox acted with reckless disregard for the truth. “It’s a rarity that we’ll see something of this caliber play out in front of a jury,” said RonNell Andersen Jones, a first amendment scholar at the University of Utah. 2.00pm BST Fox News faces major test as Dominion defamation case goes to trial Good morning, US politics blog readers. The biggest news this morning is happening in Wilmington, Delaware, where the defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News is going to trial. Dominion, which makes hardware and software used in elections, is suing the conservative news outlet on claims it knowingly defamed its business in the aftermath of the 2020 election, when Fox was a leading conduit for Donald Trump ’s unfounded conspiracy theories of vote rigging. Dominion wants the huge sum of $1.6bn for the damage caused, and the trial could see top Fox executives such as owner its Rupert Murdoch appear on the witness stand. We’ll see what emerges from the courtroom today. Here’s what else is going on: Florida governor Ron DeSantis is heading to Washington DC to meet with Republicans in Congress as he continues his slow, sure progress towards announcing a run for president. Joe Biden will deliver remarks on his efforts to lower childcare costs at 2pm ET. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre will brief reporters at 2.45 pm. A Republican-led House committee on the Covid-19 pandemic holds a hearing at 9.30am examining the origins of the virus and China’s involvement.",

An elderly man was taken to hospital with bite injuries that are not believed to be life-threatening after the incident in Willow Gardens, in the Winson Green area of Birmingham, shortly after 2.30pm on Tuesday. Five other people arrived at hospital with bite injuries, which are also not believed to be life-threatening. The road where the attack took place is near Barford primary school, which was reportedly put into lockdown for an hour until the dogs were removed. West Midlands police said a 28-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possessing a dog that was dangerously out of control. Both dogs were seized by officers and taken to secure kennels, the force added. Police said in a statement: “We were called to Willow Gardens, Winson Green, shortly after 2.30pm today [18 April], following reports two dogs were on the loose and attacking people. “An elderly man was taken to hospital with bite injuries which are not believed to be life-threatening. Five other people have been presented at hospital with bite injuries which are also not believed to be life-threatening.” The BBC reported that parents and carers of pupils at Barford primary school were sent a text message alerting them to reports of “potentially very dangerous dogs circling the school”. Anyone with information is asked to contact West Midlands police through Live Chat on the force’s website or by calling 101 and quoting log number 2743 of 18 April.",

    "content": "Chelsea (3-4-2-1) \n Kepa Arrizabalaga (GK) The Spaniard stood up to his first test, denying Luka Modric with a sharp save. He was exposed for both of Madrid’s goals in the second half. 6/10 \n Wesley Fofana (RCB) The defender had a nightmare during the first leg and was keen to make amends. He played with aggression against Vinícius and tried to support the attack. 7 \n \n Related: Boehly’s Chelsea show the distorting effect of money without sense or love | Barney Ronay \n \n Thiago Silva (CB) The veteran made some important interceptions and coped with Karim Benzema. However, Silva forces Chelsea to defend deep and he was beaten by Fede Valverde for Madrid’s second goal. 6 \n Trevoh Chalobah (LCB) Kalidou Koulibaly’s replacement gave his all and delivered a wholehearted performance but his defending for the goal was naive. Rodrygo punished him for diving in. 6 \n Reece James (RWB) A dominant figure on the right flank during the first half. James looked sharper and his crosses caused problems. Booked for a bad foul on Eduardo Camavinga. 7 \n Enzo Fernández (CM) The £106.8m midfielder was guilty of some poor deliveries from set-pieces. Fernández was busy on the ball and threatened an equaliser but he needed to offer more in possession. 6 \n Mateo Kovacic (CM) The Croatian tried to maintain Chelsea’s early tempo and was involved in an engaging battle with Madrid’s midfielders. He made no difference in the key areas. 6 \n Marc Cucurella (LWB) In for the suspended Ben Chilwell, the much-maligned Spaniard got into some good positions but he lacked conviction and wasted an easy chance just before half-time. 6 \n N’Golo Kanté (AM) Pushed on and unsettled Real Madrid with his dynamism. However, he is not a natural attacker and he missed a glorious chance to give Chelsea an early lead. 6 \n Conor Gallagher (AM) A surprise selection in an advanced role, the midfielder tried to influence the game with his energetic running. Ultimately, he lacked the quality to hurt Madrid. 6 \n Kai Havertz (CF) The German needed more support. He battled against his markers but could not find space in the box. One run hinted at promise but Havertz’s shot was tame. 6 \n Substitutes: Mykhailo Mudryk (for Cucurella 68) 5 ; Raheem Sterling (for Fernández 67) 5 ; João Félix (for Gallagher 67) 5 ; Mason Mount (for Havertz 77) 6 . \n Real Madrid (4-3-3) \n Thibaut Courtois (GK) The Belgian was barracked on his return to his old club. Courtois responded with a spectacular save from Cucurella. He wound up the Chelsea fans by kissing the badge. 8 \n Dani Carvajal (RB) The dependable Spaniard had to be dogged against the persistence of Cucurella. Carvajal stood firm and did not let anyone down. He also kept Mudryk quiet. 7 \n Éder Militão (CB) Out of the next game after picking up a booking. He made a vital block on Kanté but was fortunate not to be sent off when he caught Chalobah. 6 \n David Alaba (CB) The Austrian had to go off at half-time and was replaced by Antonio Rudiger, who was unsurprisingly keen to impress against his old club. 6 \n Eduardo Camavinga (LB) The teenager is not a natural full-back and Chelsea looked to target his inexperience. James, Fofana and Kanté outnumbered Camavinga, who did well to keep his calm. 6 \n Luka Modric (CM) The Croatian caused surprise by misplacing a few passes in the first half but there were plenty of moments when he threatened to pick Chelsea apart. 7 \n Toni Kroos (CM) So cool on the ball. The German sat deep and sought to calm things down with some measured passing. Chelsea were never able to knock him off his stride. 7 \n \n Related: Real Madrid’s Rodrygo floors Chelsea to seal Champions League semi-final spot \n \n Fede Valverde (CM) The Uruguayan is Madrid’s engine in midfield. He ran the length of the pitch at one stage to create a chance. He made Rodrygo’s second with a fine run. 8 \n Rodrygo (RW) The winger was quiet during the first half but still lashed a shot against the woodwork. He then burst into life during the second half and finished Chelsea off. 8 (MOTM) \n Karim Benzema (CF) The striker went down with an early injury and was subdued. Benzema gave the ball away and shot straight at Arrizabalaga in the second half. 6 \n Vinícius Júnior (LW) The Brazilian was Madrid’s biggest threat. Chelsea tried to keep as many men on him as possible. But Vinícius was a constant threat and he produced a composed assist for Rodrygo. 8 \n Substitutes: Antonio Rüdiger (for Alaba ht) 7 ; Dani Ceballos (for Kroos 76) 6 ; Aurelien Tchouaméni (for Benzema 71) 7 ; Nacho (for Carvajal 82) 6 ; Marco Asensio (for Rodrygo 81) 6 .",

    "title": "Cancer survivors may be at heightened risk of cardiovascular disease",
    "author": "Linda Geddes Science correspondent",
    "content": "People who survive cancer may be at heightened risk of cardiovascular disease in subsequent years, data suggests. However, heart scans may identify early heart damage, potentially opening the door to more tailored follow-up care for cancer survivors. Although previous studies have suggested that people who have been treated for cancer may be at greater risk of future cardiovascular problems such as stroke or heart failure, these have mainly focused on the first year after a cancer diagnosis. Few have looked at longer term risks or included cardiovascular imaging to pinpoint damage that has not yet resulted in symptoms. To plug these gaps, Dr Zahra Raisi-Estabragh at Queen Mary University of London and her colleagues assessed the cardiovascular health of 18,714 UK Biobank participants with a previous diagnosis of lung, breast, prostate, blood, womb or bowel cancer, and compared them with an equal number of participants with no cancer history, tracking their cardiovascular health for nearly 12 years. Almost a third of cancer survivors developed a cardiovascular problem during the study period, compared with a quarter of people in the control group. The highest rates of new cardiovascular disease occurred in individuals who had survived lung or blood cancer, with almost half of them developing a cardiovascular problem in subsequent years – the most common being ischaemic heart disease, an abnormal heart rhythm and heart failure. By contrast, the most common cardiovascular problems among breast cancer survivors were heart failure, inflammation of the lining around the heart (pericarditis) and mechanical heart problems. These differences were most likely to be a reflection of specific characteristics of the cancer and its therapies, Raisi-Estabragh said. The team also examined cardiac MRI scan results for the 1,354 study participants for whom these were available. Doing so revealed significant and detrimental changes in the size and function of the heart in breast and blood cancers survivors. The findings are published in the journal Heart . Although this was an observational study, and cannot prove that the cancer, or cancer treatments, were the cause of this increased cardiovascular risk, patients with blood cancers were exposed to chemotherapies known to be harmful to heart tissue, as well as radiotherapy that targeted the chest wall, the researchers explained. Some breast cancer therapies were also known to affect heart function, although it was likely that shared vascular risk factors, such as smoking, being overweight or having diabetes – as well as biological processes related to the cancer itself – also contributed to this increased cardiovascular risk among cancer survivors. Related: Why don’t whales get cancer? Cracking one of medicine’s greatest mysteries “This study adds to existing knowledge about the impact of some cancer treatments on cardiovascular disease in cancer survivors,” said Martin Ledwick, the head information nurse at Cancer Research UK. “It may help to inform strategies for how some cancer survivors need to be monitored long-term, especially in situations where they have been discharged from cancer follow-up to the care of their GPs.” Writing in a linked editorial , Prof Jose Banchs of the University of Colorado and Dr Tara Lech from Beth Israel Lahey Health in Massachusetts, said: “The fantastic progress in the treatment and even cure of malignancies has undoubtedly highlighted the need for post-cancer care like never before.” Confirmation that enhanced cardiovascular risk extended for a prolonged time after a cancer diagnosis – and that certain detrimental changes could potentially be identified on heart scans before patients developed symptoms – should enable doctors to start refining follow-up strategies for such individuals. “This study opens the door to some precision in the follow-up care of cancer survivors,” they said.",

    "title": "UN rebukes Washington over reports it eavesdropped on secretary general ",
    "author": "Lauren Gambino in Washington",
    "content": "The United Nations has raised concerns with the United States over reports that it eavesdropped on the private conversations of the UN secretary general, António Guterres, and other senior officials. “We have made it clear that such actions are inconsistent with the obligations of the United States as enumerated in the Charter of the United Nations and the convention on the privileges and immunities of the United Nations,” said a UN spokesman, Stephane Dujarric, on Tuesday. The comments followed a number of articles reporting that leaked Pentagon files appear to show Washington was closely monitoring conversations between the secretary general and his aides. The Washington Post reported this week that the documents included embarrassing allegations that Guterres had expressed frustration with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and “outrage” when his plans to visit a war-torn region of Ethiopia were rebuffed. It followed a BBC report last week that the US felt Guterres was too sympathetic to Russian interests when he helped broker the Black Sea grain deal amid fears of a global food crisis. According to the broadcaster, one classified Pentagon file indicated that Guterres preferred to preserve the deal even if it meant accommodating Russian interests. The UN’s implied rebuke on Tuesday comes as Washington scrambles to contain the fallout of the worst leaks of US intelligence in at least a decade. The classified reports were part of a trove of hundreds of secret national security documents, published on the online gaming platform, Discord , and revealed secrets about US, allied and Ukrainian military deployments, US penetration of Russian intelligence and military networks , and US intelligence eavesdropping on key allies, including South Korea and Israel. Jack Teixeira, a 21-year-old air national guardsman was arrested last week on suspicion of leaking hundreds of secret defence documents and charged under the Espionage Act. In response to the leaks, Pentagon has moved to tighten access to classified information while the Department of Defense reviews its security procedures. According to the BBC, a Pentagon assessment describing private conversations between the UN chief and his deputy, concluded: “Guterres emphasised his efforts to improve Russia’s ability to export,” and that he would do this, “even if that involves sanctioned Russian entities or individuals”. The secretary general’s approach, one document reportedly said, was “undermining broader efforts to hold Moscow accountable for its actions in Ukraine”. The documents viewed by the Post suggest that Guterres was “really pissed off” after an appearance with Zelenskiy in March. During the visit, Guterres was reportedly surprised Ukrainian officials photographed him at a public presentation of medals to uniformed soldiers and later shared the images in a way that suggested Guterres had congratulated Ukrainian military personnel. The secretary general, who has repeatedly condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a violation of the UN charter and international law, “emphasized that he made a point of not smiling the entire time”, according to the leaked US assessment. Last week, Dujarric said Guterres was “not surprised” that he was allegedly spied on by the US. “Unfortunately, for various reasons, it allows such private conversations to be distorted and made public.” The US has a long history of eavesdropping on allied leaders, including United Nations officials. The National Security Agency monitored the phone conversations of dozens of world leaders , including the then German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and UN diplomats , according to revelations made public by the whistleblower Edward Snowden. And in 2003, a secret memo detailed an “aggressive surveillance operation” against UN security council delegations in New York as part of a campaign to win support for going to war against Iraq .",

    "title": " Fox and Dominion settle for $787.5m in defamation lawsuit over US election lies",
    "author": "Sam Levine and Kira Lerner in Wilmington, Delaware",
    "content": "Fox and the voting equipment company Dominion reached a $787.5m settlement in a closely watched defamation lawsuit, ending a dispute over whether the network and its parent company knowingly broadcast false and outlandish allegations that Dominion was involved in a plot to steal the 2020 election. \n The settlement came before scheduled opening statements and after an unexpected lengthy delay on Tuesday afternoon just after the jury was sworn in. Neither party immediately disclosed the terms of the settlement other than the dollar amount, and attorneys for Dominion declined to answer questions about whether it requires Fox to issue a retraction or a formal apology. \n \n Related: Succession anxiety: bombshell claims about Rupert Murdoch and family \n \n “The parties have resolved their case,” Judge Eric Davis told jurors on Tuesday afternoon before excusing them from the courtroom. \n In a press conference outside the courthouse, the Dominion attorney Justin Nelson said the more than $787m represented “vindication and accountability”. The settlement amount is less than half of the $1.6bn Dominion demanded in its lawsuit. \n “Truth matters,” he said. “Lies have consequences. The truth does not know red or blue,” he continued. “People across the political spectrum can and should disagree on issues, even of the most profound importance. But for our democracy to endure another 250 years and hopefully much longer, we must share a commitment to facts.” \n In a statement, Fox said the settlement reflected its “continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards”. \n “We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues,” the statement said. \n Opening statements were scheduled to start on Tuesday after a lunch break, but the judge and jurors did not return to the room until close to 4pm. During the more than two-hour delay, attorneys huddled and left the courtroom to convene in adjacent meeting rooms. \n After returning to the courtroom, Davis thanked the jurors for their service, and called the efforts by the lawyers on both sides “the best lawyering I’ve had, ever” in his career on the bench since 2010. \n The anticipated six-week jury trial was originally set to begin on Monday, but Davis, the judge overseeing the case, postponed the start of trial by a day as the sides worked to reach a settlement agreement. \n The trial in Wilmington, Delaware, was set to be a blockbuster media trial. Rupert Murdoch, the 92-year-old chief executive of Fox, was called to testify in the case, along with top Fox talent including Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, Jeanine Pirro and Maria Bartiromo. \n The lawsuit was seen as one of the most aggressive efforts to hold Fox, or any actor, accountable for spreading the lie that the 2020 election was stolen. It was a lie that led to threats against election officials across the country, and ultimately helped fuel the violent attack on the US Capitol on 6 January. Nine deaths have been linked to the event. \n Though the case was settled, Dominion had unearthed a stunning trove of internal communications from Fox laying bare how top talent and hosts knew the outlandish claims about Dominion and a stolen election were false. The extensive messages offered a remarkable insight into how some of the most powerful hosts in America did not buy the allegations they were broadcasting to their audience each night. \n Dominion, a relatively obscure company until the 2020 election, sought $1.6bn in damages in the case. It challenged repeated claims made on Fox’s air after the general election that Dominion switched votes, paid government kickbacks and was founded in Venezuela to rig elections for Hugo Chávez. \n In the press conference on Tuesday, Dominion’s CEO, John Poulos, called the settlement historic because of Fox’s admission that it was telling lies. \n “Throughout this process, we have sought accountability,” he said. “We believe the evidence brought to light through this case underscores the consequences of spreading lies. Truthful reporting in the media is essential to our democracy.” \n Even before trial, Davis had already concluded that Fox’s claims about Dominion were false . “The evidence developed in this civil proceeding demonstrates that is CRYSTAL clear that none of the Statements relating to Dominion about the 2020 election are true,” he wrote in a ruling earlier this month. \n The question that would have been before the jury was whether Fox committed “actual malice” in airing the claims. That required Dominion to show whether key decision makers were aware the claims were false or acted with reckless disregard for the truth. \n Fox still faces several legal battles related to its decision to broadcast false claims. Smartmatic, another voting equipment company, is suing the company for $2.7bn. Abby Grossberg, a former Fox employee who worked for Bartiromo and Carlson, is also suing the company, alleging she was coerced into giving misleading testimony. \n The network also faces a separate lawsuit from a shareholder who is seeking damages and argues that executives breached their fiduciary duty to the company by causing false claims about the election to be broadcast. \n During the press conference, Stephen Shackelford, an attorney who was set to give opening arguments for Dominion on Tuesday, said that the company would continue seeking accountability. \n “Money is accountability,” he said. “We got that today from Fox. But we’re not done yet. We’ve got some other people who have some accountability coming for them.”",

    "author": "Daniel Gallan",
    "content": "10.12pm BST What’s left for Chelsea this season? Joe Cole has just suggested that some players might be contacting their travel agents to plan their summer holidays. After that performance, one that David Hytner calls “toothless”, they’ll have plenty of soul searching to get through between now and then. The report from Stamford Bridge is in and with that I’ll sign off. Thanks to everyone for the comments and correspondence. Hope you enjoyed it. Til next time.. Related: Chelsea toothless as Real Madrid move into Champions League semi-final 10.08pm BST Here’s Conor Gallagher: We played well and had good chances. We had more and better chances than they did. But football is about taking your chances. Of course we’re gutted. That’s basically what wins you games [taking chances] and we haven’t got that at the minute. You need goals to win games. They did that and we didn’t. They were able to catch us on the counter a couple of times which was the risk. There was a lot of improvements from recent weeks. 9.58pm BST Full-Time: Chelsea 0-2 Real Madrid Chelsea have lost four games in a row for the first time since 1993. They crash out of the Champions League after a 4-0 aggregate loss as the current holders, Real Madrid, march on. If that all sounds like it was inevitable, believe, it wasn’t. Certainly not at half-time when Chelsea looked the better team. Or even when Kante had a shot cleared off the line by Militao with the score at 0-0. But then Madrid, as they so often do in this big European clashes, picked their moments and carved Chelsea apart to hand Rodrygo two tap ins and continue their love affair with this tournament. Chelsea had a lot of puff but ultimately not enough quality when it mattered. Courtois made some good saves but too many shots were straight at him. Real barely left third gear and will, barring a catastrophic collapse tomorrow, meet Manchester City in the last four. More reaction to come. Updated at 11.17pm BST 9.55pm BST 90+3 min: Ceballos shoots after a break. Kepa saves. The final whistle blows and a few boos ring out. 9.54pm BST 90+1 min: Madrid are still pinging it about and work it all the way to Vinicius Junior on the edge of the box over on the left. He loses it and then commits a foul. Loads of empty seats all around Stamford Bridge. 9.52pm BST 90 min: We’ll have three more minutes,. 9.51pm BST YELLOW! Chelsea (Mudryk, 89) Just a lazy hack from behind on Modric. Deserved yellow. 9.49pm BST 87 min: Was that offside? Yes. Was it beautiful? Yes it was. That ball against the grain from Valverde to Vinicus Junior was just sublime. So too was Kepa’s save. Up the other end Mudryk is offside but he misses a straight forward shot, shunting it wide with hitting the target would have been easier. 9.47pm BST 85 min: Chelsea are still pressing but Madrid are playing around them currently. That goal has really sucked the life out of the home team. Vinicius Junior can’t quite link up with Valverde who has shone since Benzema left the pitch. 9.45pm BST 83 min: Kepa makes a good grab at a cross from Valverde. Chelsea deserve something from this game. 9.44pm BST 82 min: Mudryk shoots from inside the area on the left. Guess where the shot went? Yup, straight at Courtois. He’s a brilliant goal keeper. It needs something better than that to beat him. 9.43pm BST 82 min: A double change for Madrid. Nacho on for Carvahal and Asensio replaces the double goal scorer, Rodrygo. 9.40pm BST GOAL! Chelsea 0-2 Real Madrid (Rodrygo, 80) What. A. Goal! Game over. Tie over. Goodnight Chelsea. This is just sublime. It’s a tap in for Rodrygo and he’s been set up on a silver platter by Valverde who has carved Chelsea open. Vincius Junior feeds Valverde to the edge of the area and the Uruguayan then dances round three defenders and then the goalkeeper before playing a simple pass for the Brazilian to send his team to the last four. Updated at 10.32pm BST 9.40pm BST 78 min: Modric gives the ball away and Sterling has the ball but he manages to run out of room and Madrid have a throw. The current champions haven’t won this competition 14 times by luck. They’re now starting to tighten their grip on things. 9.38pm BST Would Ancelotti turn the Blues into champions? Kári Tulinius thinks so: “Hello Daniel. With the caveat that Chelsea’s assortment of randoms is nobody’s idea of a smartly assembled squad, I can’t help but think that if the managers had been in the opposite dugouts, Real Madrid wouldn’t have had such an easy time of this tie. Best in the business, indeed.” 9.37pm BST 75 min: Both teams make a change. Havertz off for Mount and Kroos makes way for Ceballos. 9.37pm BST 75 min: Big chance for Real Madrid is snuffed out by Chalobah and Mudryk. Vinicius Junior was away but the Chelsea duo tracked him down all the way inside the Chelsea box. Mudryk then gallops up field and takes a shot that’s aimed at the top corner but sails over the bar. Brilliant end to end stuff. 9.34pm BST 73 min: Lovely play from Modric and Valverde opens space down the right. Valverde then launches a ball across the field and Madrid have a promising attack brewing. But Chelsea break and Joao Felix is leading a four on three. Oh, that is disappointing. Spoiled for choices, he passes straight to a man in white. 9.32pm BST 72 min: Joao Felix delivers a decent looking out-swinging corner but that man again, MIlitao, rises highest to header it away. 9.31pm BST 70 min: A tired looking Benzema makes way for Tchouameni. The Ballon d’Or winner wasn’t at the races today but still didn’t look happy getting the hook. Updated at 9.31pm BST 9.30pm BST 69 min: Penalty shout. Havertz loses control of it in the box and then goes down after light contact from Modric behind him. But it’s so soft and the ref tells him to get to his feet. 9.29pm BST 68 min: Sterling makes an immediate impact by dancing into the box on the right. It squirts to James who shoots first time but Militao – who has been immense – stands in the way to block it out for a corner. 9.28pm BST 66 min: Triple sub. Cucurella, Enzo Fernadnez and Gallagher make way for Sterling, Joao Felix and Mudryk. 9.27pm BST “At what stage can we tell Frank that he’s fooling nobody and should take a clippers to what’s left of his hair” This was put to me by Matthew Lysaght . As a bald man who held on for too long, I’d always recommend getting the clippers out! 9.26pm BST 65 min: Now Benzema shoots straight at the ‘keeper. Vincius Junior wriggles in the box and lays off a short pass to his skipper. He has to shoot quickly and the side-footed effort is tame. 9.25pm BST 65 min: Enzo Fernandez shoots but it’s once again straight at the ‘keeper. Cucurella did really well to keep the ball alive at the back post by leaping into the night sky and nodding it back the edge of the box. Enzo then unleashed a firm shot couldn’t find a corner. 9.24pm BST 64 min: James continues to be a one man wrecking ball. His latest charge only gets so far as MIlitao but he bulldozed past two others before that. Real Madrid now defending deep. 9.23pm BST 63 min: Looks like Sterling, Joao Felix and Mudryk all coming on. 9.22pm BST 61 min: Chelsea need to a get a move on here and Lampard is starting to empty his bench. A few players are warming up. 9.20pm BST 59 min: Another shot straight at Courtois, this time from Gallagher. They won’t lie down. 9.19pm BST Play is switched to the right and Vincius Junior skips past Chalobah down the flank and has an uninterrupted run towards goal. He has options. Rather than shoot he plays it across the face of goal. The chance looks like its gone but Rodrygo composes himself, takes a touch and then lifts it into the net from close range. Game over. Updated at 9.22pm BST 9.18pm BST GOAL! Chelsea 0-1 Real Madrid (Rodrygo, 58) Completely against the run of play. A sucker punch from the best in the business and killing dreams. Real Madrid are surely through the last four. Updated at 9.51pm BST 9.17pm BST 56 min: Havertz dances into the box and shoots with his left but it’s straight at Courtois who has an easy save. That was another chance. Not quite as clear cut as the Kante chances but he had a clean sight of goal from just inside the area. 9.16pm BST 55 min: Kroos slides in and takes out Kovacic. The atmosphere is starting to get heated. We’ve got a game here. 9.16pm BST 54 min: Reece James is having an absolute blinder. Every time he gets on the ball he’s making something happen. Now playing on the left hi darts infield and finds Enzo Fernandez. The midfielder unleashes a daisy cutter that’s always going across the face of the goal. 9.14pm BST 53 min: Madrid break and break well but the final ball is an odd one with Benzema making a strange run, almost consciously away from where he should have been. Chelsea break themselves and they’re fuming as Militao fouls Chalobah. He’s on a yellow card remember and Lampard and his players are appealing for a second. Not a bookable offence in my opinion but a good opportunity to cross from the left. 9.13pm BST 52 min: Oh Kante with another chance! His block from close range is blocked on the line. It’s a cross from the right and Gallagher wins the second ball that falls for Kante. He shoots but there’s a body dressed in white in the way. Militao I think but he wouldn’t have known too much about it. Updated at 9.17pm BST 9.11pm BST YELLOW! Chelsea (James, 50) James catches Camavinga and that looks nasty. He’s stayed down. It’s not career threatening by any means but those hurt when you make contact just above the heel.. 9.09pm BST 49 min: To confirm, Rudiger is on for Alaba. 9.09pm BST 48 min: The short corner is eventually cleared by Thiago Silva. Chelsea can’t get on the ball and Kovacic fouls Kroos in the middle of the park. Madrid made a half-time switch by nringing on Rudiger. I can’t quite figure out for who just yet. Stand by. Updated at 9.09pm BST 9.07pm BST 47 min: Kroos lifts an awkward ball to the back post. It’s aimed at Benzema but instead its nudged behind for a corner. 9.07pm BST 45 min: Militao steps up from his line and dances past Kovacic before spreading the ball left. Fofana then upends Vincius Junior. Oooh, actually, looked like he slipped. If Madrid score from this free kick, well… 9.06pm BST And they’re back at it. The most important 45 minutes of Chelsea’s season coming up. They need two goals. They’ve shown they can do it. 9.04pm BST Once again I’m giving Justin Madson the final word before the restart. Here’s his retort to Chris Lambert from earlier: “A lot of the money (particularly in January) was spent on young talent that needs to develop. Boehly didn’t go out and buy all the biggest names from all the biggest teams, or get bargains like 60 million for Haaland. To expect them to come in and be automatic world beaters is unreasonable. There was always a high probability that the players were going to need time to adjust, particularly with all the managerial shenanigans. I’m not saying I’m thrilled with where things are, absolutely not. But I don’t think the spending spree will prove to be as unproductive as the general internet fandom thinks it has. As to the game: it’s taken some amazing work from Courtois (boooooo) to keep Chelsea out. Positive 45 for Chelsea. Kante proving he’s not a ghost, though I wish that chance had fallen to literally anyone else.” 9.03pm BST I’m getting a lot of correspondence from Everton fans who are understandably upset about some of the daggers shared on this blog earlier. That’s my bad. I should have kept the chat exclusively centred on Chelsea and Madrid tonight. I thought it was just a bit o bantz but appreciate that it can get emotionally charged. For what it’s worth (and believe me, it ain’t worth much) I hope Everton stay up. Please don’t ask me which clubs I’d be happy to see relegated. 9.00pm BST Just a reminder to anyone just joining us, Real Madrid are 2-0 up on aggregate . That means Chelsea need at least two goals. Unless of course Real get another one. 8.56pm BST “Where has this Chelsea team been all season?” asks Dean Kinsella . “Reece James easilly the most outstanding player on the park. The Madridistas are going to have to come up with something to nullify him.” Agreed. He’s been the best player on the park. Let’s hope his hammy holds up. Updated at 9.10pm BST 8.53pm BST Phew. that was fun. Really good from the home side who have shown that they’re so much better than the season they’re having. Some reaction and bits to come… 8.51pm BST Half-Time: Chelsea 0-0 Real Madrid Chelsea are still in this but on another night they’d be all square. Unquestionably they should have at least one goal as Cucurella’s golden opportunity was swatted aside by a brutally good piece of goal keeping from Courtois, charging off his line to smother a close range shot. Earlier in the piece, Kante skewed his shot from a bouncing ball. One wonders what might have been had those two chances landed at the feet of anyone else. The visitors had a chance too with Vinicius Junior mistiming his side footed effort from a fizzing Modric cross to the back post. If that went in that would probably be that but Chelsea are still alive and showed enough quality in the first half to win it. 8.48pm BST 45+1 min: HOW IS IT 0-0!? What a save from Courtois. James’ cross from the right goes all the way to Cucurella at the far post. He controls, steadies and shoots but the behemoth Real Madrid goal keeper is off his line and making himself massive, saving with his outstretched hand. Wonderful keeping but that really ought to be 1-0. Updated at 9.24pm BST 8.46pm BST 45 min: Two more minutes will be played this half. 8.46pm BST 44 min: A chance to put a cross in from a free kick for Real but Alaba’s delivery is weak. For all the quality tonight the set pieces have been pretty poor. 8.45pm BST 43 min: Chelsea have a corner with Cucurella swinging it in. Benzema makes a mess of his clearance so the Chelsea man gets another chance. He goes short and sends another in-swinger from a different angle. Courtois catches it and launches a counter that ends with Benzema volleying at the back post but he can’t wrap his foot around it. It’s goalless but this has been a lot of fun. 8.43pm BST 41 min: Oh wow, big chance for Madrid. Mordic on the right puts in a wonderful ball to the back post where Vinicus Junior gets ahead of Fofana. The smart money is on him scoring but it skims off his shins and out for a goal kick. 8.42pm BST 41 min: Enzo Fernandez (I think that’s the first time I’ve mentioned him) plays a delicious looking through ball Gallagher can’t reach it. 8.41pm BST 40 min: Cucurella’s left footed in-swinger is nudged on by Havertz. In fact it hits his back somehow. Still, it’s diverted towards the back post but Gallagher can’t reach it so it’ll be a goal kick. Updated at 8.42pm BST 8.41pm BST 39 min: James seems OK as he jinks past a tackler and plays a neat one-two with Fofa. He’s now playing with Kante down the right and the little midfielder wins a corner with some aggressive play at the byline. Chelsea starting to find a higher gear. 8.40pm BST 38 min: James’ chance to slip Kante down the right. Again a cross doesn’t come to anything. James is back defending and intercepts a through ball from Modric but he’s holding his hamstring. That is not ideal. He’s been Chelsea’s leading man this evening. 8.38pm BST 36 min: Good from Chelsea who looks composed on the ball. Kante and Thiago Silva both with expert touches. Kante then puts James down the right on the overlap. He crosses near the byline but can’t get it past the first defender. How is this team 11th in the Premier League? They’ve genuinely been very good. 8.36pm BST YELLOW! Chelsea (Cucurella, 34) No complaints there. A heavy touch means Rodrygo can break from deep. Cucurella was having none of it and upended him as he was climbing through the gears. Updated at 8.42pm BST 8.35pm BST 33 min: Another save from Kepa. Modric’s late surge into the box is dangerous as he collects on the gallop. But he’s forced wide and forced to shoot. It’s on target but Kepa is always going to save that. It’s out for a corner and Chelsea do well to clear. More breathing room is provided from Rodrygo who needlessly fouls Cucurella. 8.33pm BST 31 min: Gallagher heads it over. it wouldn’t have counted as there was an offside but another slick move. Thiago Silva with a long diagonal from just inside Madrid’s half. It’s for Cucurella who is offside. His cross to Gallagher is loopy and the midfielder can’t get his head over it. Up the other end, Benzema fluffs a shot that dribbles to Kepa. 8.31pm BST 29 min: James is everywhere. He collects with his heels on the perimeter but cuts infield and wriggles past two before laying it off. It’s worked to Gallagher and then Cucurella but once again the cross from the left is too deep. A poor cross or not enough bodies in the mixer? 8.30pm BST 27 min: Benzema plays a one-two with Rodrygo who then slides Vinicius Junior down the left. He runs clear towards goal and shoots hard, but straight at Kepa. I think there was an offside there but the ‘keeper didn’t know it at the time. That was a string hand from the Chelsea shot stopper. 8.28pm BST 26 min: Kroos gets clattered but it’s play on. Chelsea are snapping with greater ferocity at the heels of their guests. Eventually Madrid get a free kick after Thiago Silva goes through the back of Benzema on the half way line. Chelsea will be happy with that passage. 8.27pm BST 25 min: Kante wins the ball back in midfield and keeps it moving to James. Neat work in the middle of the park has it spread to the left where Gallagher crosses but it’s too long. Looked like a decent ball but no one gambled with a run to the far post. 8.25pm BST It’s a good point. Perhaps he’s saving him for a second half flourish? @danielgallan Hi from Norway. I know Lampard has been focused on he lower areas of the PL this season, but surely they have seen some vids of Madrid. They obviously didn't see the Shakhtar Donetsk game where Mudryk terrified them. Surely he would be worth a go? — Brendan Large (@brendanlarge) April 18, 2023 8.24pm BST 23 min: Yet again a Chelsea set piece ball was too short. Frustrating for the home side. Militao is down clutching his ankle. I’m sure he’ll be fine. 8.23pm BST YELLOW! Real Madrid (Militao, 22) A needless challenge from behind with Chelsea going nowhere has given the home side a chance to cross and landed one of the Madrid centre backs in the naughty book. Updated at 8.36pm BST 8.23pm BST Folks, don’t shoot the messenger, but here’s more love-hate Chelsea bantz from our readers: “Not sure how it’s “harsh” to wade in on the fact that Chelsea have spent 600 actual million pounds sterling in order to have the Arsenal-reject edition of Aubameyang as their no.9 and be behind Fulham in the league. Criticism is baked into that price when the result is this sh*t” That’s from Chris Lambert. 8.22pm BST 19 min: BANG! Rodrygo caught all of that one and smashed the side of the post from an acute angle. Kepa probably had that covered but that was fiercely struck from inside the area to the left of the goal. Neat interplay before that with Modric involved was a warning to Chelsea. All it’ll take is a flash of brilliance and Rodrygo almost provided that. 8.20pm BST Quick correspondence from Tim Woods as Madrid settle on the ball: “While I’d agree with Duncan Edwards about Everton going down, if he thinks we all want a United comeback v Sevilla, he’s wrong. Two own goals in the last five minutes was one of my highlights of the season - which, as a Liverpool fan, have been slightly harder to come by this time around.” 8.19pm BST 17 min: James is across to take this and send in an in-swinger with his right foot. But it’s short and Militao meets it on the half volley and smashes it up field. It comes right back and Thiago Silva is still up there, knocking the ball back across the face of the gaol with his head. But Madrid tidy up and Courtois gets his humungous gloves on it. 8.18pm BST 16 min: Chelsea on the front foot now, really playing with a swagger. Havertz coming short, Gallagher with deft touches, Cucurella winning a corner on the left. Really good. 8.17pm BST 15 min: James is looking sharp on the right win. He’s picked out again – maybe the fifth time – but on this occasion Vinicius Junior tracks back and makes sure the ball trickles out for a goal kick. That’s one way to keep the Madrid winger quiet. 8.16pm BST 13 min: James handballs inside the area. That was a hard one to control after Chalobah slipped Havertz behind the Madrid defence and towards the byline. His dinked chip back across goal skimmed off the surface and James used his forearm to bring it down. Good move though. 8.14pm BST 12 min: Modric gives the ball away again. That’s twice in 12 minutes. 8.13pm BST 10 min: Kante misses from right in front! Of all the midfielders for that to fall to, why was it Kante? Still, he should have done better. It begins with a brilliant ball to James out wide and the cross to Havertz is deflected back to Kante who swipes at a bouncing ball but skews it wide when he could have put it anywhere. He could have even taken a touch. Huge chance. Updated at 8.25pm BST 8.11pm BST 9 min: Boos ring out as Courtois gets the ball. A rare loose ball from Modric has the Gallagher excited but he’s closed down quickly. A ‘quick’ one here from Justin Madson regarding the hate for the Blues this evening: “ I have some qualms about some of these critiques. What lineup doesn’t include a false nine with this Chelsea squad? Aubaumeyang has been poor every time he plays, to the point that acquisition just felt like a favor to his agent. Thiago Silva is not just a “38-year-old CB”, he is one of the best CBs in the entire world. The “ghost” of Kante is quite harsh, as he’s had limited action in the 5 matches since returning from a long-term injury. The point about Kai up front “alone” is addressed above. Though, I will not argue we are overstocked in some positions and understocked in others. We could talk about how 3 Chelsea academy players are starting, but then we’d be on about the Mount exclusion. Be as harsh as you like, there isn’t a Chelsea formation or squad that would not be second guessed at this point.” 8.09pm BST 7 min: Slick from Vinicius Junior. Militao sprays a pass all the way to the left flank where the wide man brings it under control, cuts onto his right foot and delivers a cross in the blink of an eye. It’s over hit but that was very sharp. 8.08pm BST 6 min: Benzema and Thiago Silva get in a tussle. That’ll be fun as this develops. All Real with the ball though Chelsea not pressing with great intent. Looking to snatch the ball and counter when the opportunity strikes perhaps. 8.06pm BST 5 min: Valverde can’t slide that pass in behind for Vinicus Junior but Real have the ball back immediately. They’re the definitely sharper of the two sides early on. 8.05pm BST 3 min: Madrid with natural width in Rodrygo. Looking to make the pitch wide. They’re keeping the ball with Militao looking assured on the ball and Kroos coming deep to help. 8.03pm BST 1 min: Gallagher can’t keep a ball under control but his position – all the way to the left – will be crucial. Not much width in this otherwise narrow line-up. Massive game for the youngster. 8.02pm BST PEEEEEP! Away they go. Chelsea in all blue. Real Madrid in white with black socks. Looks a picture. 8.00pm BST Not sure if this a bad omen but the stadium’s speakers, the ones that were supposed to blast out the Champions League anthem, have failed. Instead the players stood around looking rather glum. Is it a Champions League game without the Champions League anthem? Is any of this real? Does any of it matter? Just a minute or two til kick-off. 7.59pm BST As the players make their way out onto the pitch, the final word before kick-off goes to Richard Hirst : “I hope Chelsea get a good kicking tonight, not solely because I’m a Fulham supporter but also because it might serve as a warning to other billionaire owners. Fulham’s recruitment after our first two promotions was pretty dire, but for the Whites to be above Chelsea at this stage in the season shows how truly abysmally they have been run.” Yeeowch! Not a lot of love for the Blues. Then again, they haven’t exactly covered themselves in glory on or off the pitch this season. A win here would certainly sort that out. 7.55pm BST “ Evening Daniel, I’ll keep this short and sweet” My fingertips thank you, Simon Kirchin . “I reckon there are goals in this Chelsea team. For Real Madrid.” Cheeky. Updated at 8.09pm BST 7.54pm BST Duncan Edwards is happy to sit on the fence and enjoy the footy. Good on ya mate. Let’s just hope for a good game. “Hi Daniel Having won the first leg in second gear I’d be shocked if Real Madrid had to get into third to win again tonight. An early Chelsea brace might at least force that, and let’s be honest that’s what we all want to see - along with Everton finally relegated and United coming back to slam Sevilla - isn’t it, eh? Cheers!” So much for fence sitting. Not sure many Toffee fans will agree. But yes to the rest. 7.52pm BST Justin Winter has been in touch lambesting the Guardian’s coverage of both Chelsea and Manchester City. He calls us all “ a bunch of w*****s” but signs off his mail with “kind regards” . Keep it classy J-Dog. 7.49pm BST Some formation news: Chelsea with a back three and two wide men pushed high up the picth. According to UEFA’s teamsheet it’s a 3-3-3-1. Funky. Real Madrid meanwhile are keeping it more compact as they’ll likely look to catch Chelsea’s free wheelers on the break. They’ve opted for a more pragmatic 4-3-3. Updated at 8.01pm BST 7.47pm BST Callum Flintoff , or Mr Flintoff to his students, is hoping for a mircale: “Believing in a miracle tonight. Lots of pupils who will never hear the end of this tomorrow if we can do the impossible.” Mr Flintoff, if your Blues do pull it off, I hope you give your class an extended break and an early exit. (If any of Mr Flintoff’s students are reading this, please do get in touch) 7.45pm BST Jeff Sax has gone to bat for Lampard: “His team selection is a big success amongst mbm fans, at least” Though he also says that the Ancelotti v Lampard battle is one between a “ professional and a clown ”. He then uses a word I’m not sure I’m allowed to type. But it’s Yiddish and rude, so you can figure it out. Jeff, tell us what you really think. 7.43pm BST What’s holding Chelsea back this season? Is it leadership? Or do they have too many players but none of serious quality? Jacob Steinberg wades into this chicken-and-egg debate in a seriously thoughtful and switched on piece. Related: Do Chelsea have the leaders or quality to offer any fightback against Real Madrid? 7.40pm BST “Season on the line and Lampard fields one singular attacker and even that is a false nine. I despise chelsea and Lampard but that lineup is so insane that I have to root for it.” No matter what happens tonight, Frank Lampard has turned Sean Orlowicz into a fan. 7.39pm BST “ Hi Daniel. Is it really worthwhile for Chelsea to even consider winning tonight as if they do and get through they’ll only have to go through the torture of two more legs against Man City??!” If they get out of the frying pan they'd land straight in the fire, eh Nigel Moore. But it would be some mighty leap. So Worthing having a go I reckon. 7.36pm BST “Hi Daniel,” Hey Peter Oh. Good to hear from you. “ With these two managers in charge this starry European night has got a whiff of Everton about it, doesn’t it? ” That's about as close as the Toffees will get to European football. 7.35pm BST This from David John Watton is presented in all its glory: “Hi Daniel, you look a bit like if me and Rob Smyth had a baby - suspect there’s an MBM theme happening here. Ringing endorsement of the £500m Chelsea have spent that they’re going into a do-or-die Champions League game against Madrid with an (admittedly outstanding) 38 year old centre back, the ghost of N’Golo Kante in the middle and Havertz up top on his own. Not sure I’d be leaving six attacking players with a paper value of another couple of hundred million on the bench if I needed two goals, but maybe Frank has learnt something I don’t know whilst losing 11 of his past 12 games. Rarely has a such an expensive squad been so overstocked in some positions and so thin in others. Enjoy the match! Loving the blog .” Love thst Dave. Cheers. Right you are on those unused riches. Not sure how I feel about being compared to your love child. But I'll take it as a compliment. 7.23pm BST A few readers have commented on Chelsea’s attacking approach line-up tonight. After all, they’ve got nothing to lose. This could be their last game of any substance for the season. Might as well have a go. “ Well, that Chelsea line-up looks full of goals….” says Julien Menz . “ Please excuse my weary cynicism. I’m a Chelsea fan.” 7.14pm BST Frank Lampard’s pre-match thoughts \"One of my worst seasons was when we won the Champions League!\" 🏆 \"The players need to be aware of that. We have to believe!\" 🙌 Frank Lampard gives his thoughts before a hugely important #UCL clash with Real Madrid... 🎙️ @mrjakehumphrey | @rioferdy5 | @themichaelowen pic.twitter.com/2A3KuPgnRB — Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) April 18, 2023 7.12pm BST Don Carlo back at the Bridge! 🙌 #UCL pic.twitter.com/9TEAQ9yWjm — Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) April 18, 2023 7.10pm BST Jacob Steinberg’s preview Related: Do Chelsea have the leaders or quality to offer any fightback against Real Madrid? 7.04pm BST Of course, as is so often the case with Chelsea, it’s not just the fate of a ball on our minds. The Oligarch Files, as this sweeping investigation by Rob Davies and David Conn has been dubbed, shows the shocking links between the former owner, Roman Abramovich and Vladimir Putin.

Well, Frank Lampard wouldn’t have made them if he thought they wouldn’t. Those are Chalobah for Koulibaly (injured), Cucurella for Chilwell (suspended), then Gallagher and Havertz for Sterling and Joao Felix. Plenty of attacking talent on the bench so there should be no excuses tonight. They have to score twice. Possibly more if Real get one of their own. Nothing to lose. Chelsea: Kepa, Fofana, Silva (c), Chalobah, James, Kovacic, Enzo, Kante, Cucurella, Gallagher, Havertz. Replacements: Mendy, Azpilicueta, Hall, Chukwuemeka, Loftus-Cheek, Mount, Zakaria, Mudryk, Pulisic, Sterling, Ziyech, Joao Felix.

Confident that the same players can turn over Chelsea yet again, Carlo Ancelotti has named the same team that won 2-0 in the opening leg. Real Madrid: Courtois, Carvajal, Militao, Alaba, Camavinga, Valverde, Kroos, Modric, Rodrygo, Benzema (c), Vinicius Junior.

I mean we can all agree that this isn’t going to happen. Opta’s ‘Supercomputer’ (whatever that is) reckons Real Madrid have a 40.6% chance of winning tonight. Considering a draw is one of three possible results, and that Chelsea need to overturn a 2-0 deficit , that probably means Frank Lampard’s team are heading for the Champions League exit door. But strange things occur all the time in football (don’t snigger, hear me out). And this is a Chelsea side stacked with world class talent despite their league position and the humbling they endured this weekend at home to Brighton . Anyone remember this mad night in Barcelona when Fernando Torres plucked a ball from the heavens and delivered the Blues to the Champions League final? Like I said, strange things happen in this sport and I can honestly see them going on to nick it. I don’t care what the supercomputer says. If Chelsea score first and score early, well then, we might just be in for a classic. My name is Daniel. I’m thrilled to be with you as he build towards this Champions League quarterfinal second leg tie at Stamford Bridge. If you’ve got anything you want to share with the group please drop me a mail or send over a tweet. There’s no comment too trivial or complex that isn’t welcome. Kick off at 8pm BST .

    "author": "Dominic Rushe in New York",
    "content": "It’s time to say goodbye to those red envelopes. Netflix announced on Tuesday that it would end 25 years of mailing DVDs of shows and movies to its subscribers. Netflix’s co-chief executive Ted Sarandos said mailing DVDs had “paved the way for the shift to streaming”, but that “after an incredible 25-year run, we’ve made the difficult decision to wind down at the end of September”. “Our goal has always been to provide the best service for our members but as the business continues to shrink that’s going to become increasingly difficult,” Sarandos said. Related: ‘A living museum’: what it’s like using Netflix’s DVD-by-mail in 2022 Netflix launched as an alternative to video rental stores, allowing customers to rent DVDs that were sent to their homes. The first DVD it sent out was a copy of Tim Burton’s 1988 classic Beetlejuice. The business model took off, and soon Blockbuster, the biggest video rental store chain, and its rivals were in trouble. But the shift to streaming has eaten away at the company’s DVD by post business, and accounted for $126m of Netflix’s $31.6bn in revenues last year. The announcement of the end of the postal service came as Netflix posted a mixed bag of results for the first quarter of the year. The company’s revenues for the quarter were $8.18bn, slightly less than analysts had forecast. But Netflix added 1.75million subscribers and ended the period with 232.5 million customers. A year ago, Netflix announced that it had lost subscribers for the first time in a decade, an announcement that sent the company’s share price into a tailspin. Facing stiff competition from rivals including Apple, Disney and Hulu, the company has announced new ad-supported tiers and is cracking down on password-sharing. The scheme was trialled in Chile, Costa Rica and Peru. On Tuesday the company said it was delaying the broader rollout of its password-sharing crackdown, which had been set to take place late in the first quarter, but will now start more broadly by the end of June. “While this means that some of the expected membership growth and revenue benefit will fall in Q3 rather than Q2, we believe this will result in a better outcome from both our members and our business,” the company said in its earnings release.",

    "author": "David Hytner at Stamford Bridge",
    "content": "The pulse had been faint beforehand and, as expected, it was extinguished for Chelsea well before full time, this Champions League quarter-final exit sounding the death knell for their season. Frank Lampard’s team had a go, bringing the hustle in the first half and they almost fashioned a lifeline to counter the grave damage from the Bernabéu, N’Golo Kanté and Marc Cucurella missing clear chances. It was a night when Chelsea were heavy on perspiration, low on inspiration, Lampard’s lineup lacking the X factor, which is quite the oddity given the £550m lavished on new players by the ownership since their installation last May. Related: Chelsea show distorting effect of money without sense or love The cameras cut repeatedly to Todd Boehly, who did a lot of staring into space. At least there was no big talk from him here, no prediction of a 3-0 Chelsea win, which was what he had foreseen before the first leg. It was what they needed here but it never looked on, despite Chelsea being able to remember some stirring comebacks in this competition. Their past is exactly that. The fact that the chances fell to Kanté – who played as one of the No 10s in Lampard’s surprise 3-4-2-1 formation, alongside Conor Gallagher – and Cucurella told its own story. Lampard left a couple of more natural occupants for the attacking roles on the bench at the outset but the bottom line is that despite the transfer market outlay, the club have – to put it bluntly – nobody to stick the ball in the net. It all became extremely predictable, lacking refinement, Chelsea slinging in too many hopeful crosses, their final actions imprecise. They were reeled in by Real Madrid, the holders, the old masters, who will now face Manchester City or Bayern Munich in the semi-finals; surely City in what would be a repeat of last season’s meeting at the same stage. City are still not quite sure how they lost that one. This was a repeat of the quarter-final from last season – just without the drama, Chelsea’s toothlessness summed up when Mykhaylo Mudryk, on as a substitute, ran through at the end only to drag unconvincingly wide. Rodrygo did the damage for Madrid, finishing off a slick break that he initiated before the hour, and turning the screw with 10 minutes to play, swooping after Federico Valverde had sliced through Chelsea’s backline and pulled across the empty net. Rodrygo took his time, almost teasing the home team, before lifting the ball home. And so it is four defeats in four from Lampard’s caretaker management and just the one goal scored – the worst run since 1993. At least the home crowd did not turn but there is plenty of time for that across the final weeks of a barren season. Lampard’s selection was always going to invite scrutiny. In the corresponding tie last season, after Chelsea had lost the first leg 3-1 at home to Madrid, the club’s manager at the time, Thomas Tuchel, went all out with a surprise and attack-minded 4-3-1-2 lineup. He so nearly pulled off one of the great comebacks, his team succumbing in extra time. Lampard’s team had the shock factor – you would have got long odds on Kanté and Gallagher being the No 10s – and it felt as though Madrid did not know what to make of it at the outset. Lampard wanted an aggressive press from the midfield four, especially the wing-backs, Reece James and Cucurella, and the extra pair in front of them. Kai Havertz, too, at the tip of the formation. At first, he got it. The home fans found their voices and not only when directing abuse towards their former goalkeeper, Thibaut Courtois. They were particularly unimpressed when he kissed the badge on his shirt after the half-time whistle. Kanté snatched at his chance in the 10th minute, dragging a bouncing ball wide from 10 yards, and Cucurella was unnerved by the sight of Courtois rushing from his line after James had crossed, very quickly making the goal look small. Cucurella shot straight at him. Mateo Kovacic had fired the move with a darting run. James was in the mood, all strutting assurance and relish for the one-on-ones, although he would err with a yellow card stamp on Eduardo Camavinga. Related: Milan hold firm to deny Napoli after Leão’s solo run and Maignan’s saves Madrid played within themselves before the interval – apart from a few flickers on the counter. Rodrygo and Luka Modric went close and their big chance came on 41 minutes, Modric crossing and Vinícius Júnior, in front of Wesley Fofana, somehow failing to connect. It was feisty, Éder Militão running a risk with a foul on Trevoh Chalobah when he had already been booked. Kanté almost nipped on to a Gallagher header while Havertz shot at Courtois but then Madrid made their move, a clinically executed break, ignited when Rodrygo reached a Militão diagonal ahead of Chalobah’s all-or-nothing lunge. Rodrygo hared away to cross low from the byline, Karim Benzema missing the touch in the middle but Vinícius returning the ball at the far post for Rodrygo, who had bent his run back into the six-yard box. Touch. Finish. All over. And was that Courtois goading the Chelsea fans at the other end?",

    "title": "Albanese government urged to increase rent assistance and childcare workers’ pay in budget",
    "author": "Paul Karp Chief political correspondent",
    "content": "Increased rent assistance and a pay rise for all childcare and aged care workers are among the “specific and urgent” recommendations for the budget made by the women’s economic equality taskforce. The finance minister, Katy Gallagher, has released the taskforce’s advice but played down the likelihood of delivering on the wishlist all at once, noting the “tight fiscal environment” and promising to “build upon” investments in future budgets. The release comes after Tuesday’s revelation the economic inclusion committee had called for a “substantial increase” to “inadequate” jobseeker payments, which the government is unlikely to deliver in May. The committee proposed lifting jobseeker to 90% of the value of the aged pension, which would cost $24bn over four years. However, it is unclear whether the government could yet back a less substantial increase. Related: From stage-three tax cuts to welfare relief: what’s on Australia’s 2023 budget wishlist? As the taskforce chair, Sam Mostyn, told the National Press Club in March, expanding the eligibility of single parent payments and abolishing the ParentsNext program were the most pressing requests. Raising the children’s cutoff age (currently eight years old) at which parents are moved from the single parent payment to the less generous jobseeker payment is considered the reform most likely to be implemented in the budget. The fate of ParentsNext is unclear because the program could be reformed by removing penalties for non-attendance without scrapping it entirely. In a letter dated 24 March the taskforce called to abolish the childcare subsidy activity test, and pay superannuation for primary carers while they are on paid parental leave, which has been pushed by the Greens and stakeholders at the jobs and skills summit. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup It called on the government to “increase the rate of commonwealth rental assistance to improve women’s immediate housing security stemming from the lack of affordable, appropriate, and safe housing options”; and “invest in an interim pay-rise for all early childhood educators and aged care workers in recognition of the historical undervaluation of their work and the urgent need to retain and attract workers to the sector”. In February the Fair Work Commission ruled that a 15% pay rise for aged care workers needed to be introduced in one hit from July this year, rejecting the Albanese government’s call to split the increase over two years. The taskforce submitted that it was “acutely aware of the fiscal and economic pressures the government is managing” in the May budget, but said its proposals were “urgent and targeted”. The taskforce also called to raise “the base rate of income support and review of the current system of indexation of payments and analysis as to their adequacy”. “Women are tired of waiting for the right time to be prioritised,” it said. “Australian women want to believe the government’s commitment to gender equality is real, but until they see evidence of material change that centres their needs and stops the compounding disadvantage that accrues to them, they will retain a healthy scepticism.” The taskforce said that “investment in women’s economic equality is one of the smartest investments that can be made”, citing Deloitte research that found a $128bn benefit to the Australian economy from increasing women’s economic equality and participation. Gallagher welcomed the taskforce’s advice, thanking them for “their effort in reaching out to women around Australia, as well as drawing on their own significant and credible expertise and experience”. “We are considering the taskforce’s recommendations in the context of the 2023-24 budget, including what we can responsibly deliver in a tight fiscal environment,” she said. “The investments we make to drive gender equality in this budget will be built upon in subsequent budgets, in the same way that we are already building on the over $7bn investment made in the October budget to make childcare cheaper, boost paid parental leave and support women’s safety.” On Monday the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, told reporters in Canberra that “I think that people understand that we can’t do everything at once”. “We can’t do everything that we would like to do.”",

    "author": "Julia Carrie Wong",
    "content": "In a pre-dawn session on Tuesday, the Iowa state senate voted to allow children to work longer hours and serve alcohol, the latest move by Republican-controlled statehouses to combat a labor shortage by loosening child labor laws . The Iowa bill would expand the number of hours that children under 16 can work from four to six a day, allow minors to work in previously prohibited industries if they are part of a training program, and allow 16- and 17-year–olds to serve alcohol with a parent’s permission. Related: ‘It’s just crazy’: Republicans attack US child labor laws as violations rise It passed the state senate by a vote of 32-17, two Republicans joining every Democrat in opposition. The vote took place just before 5am, after protests and delay tactics by Democrats. “We do know slavery existed in the past but one place it doesn’t exist, that’s in this bill,” said Adrian Dickey, the Republican responsible for shepherding the bill to passage, according to the Iowa Capital Dispatch . “It simply is providing our youth an opportunity to earn and learn, at the same timeframe as his classmates do, while participating in sports and other fine arts.” Democrats and labor advocates decried the bill, which they say will endanger children by allowing them to work in dangerous fields such as roofing, excavation and demolition. “No Iowa teenager should be working in America’s deadliest jobs,” said Zach Wahls, the senate minority leader. “Iowa Republican politicians want to solve the … workforce crisis on the literal backs of children.” Labor unions have held protests against the bill. Charlie Wishman, president of the Iowa Federation of Labor, said efforts to loosen child labor laws around the US were “a lazy way of dealing with the fact that certain states don’t have enough workers”. In March, the Arkansas governor, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, signed legislation to roll back child labor protections. Lawmakers in Ohio, Minnesota and Wisconsin are also considering loosening regulations . “Can we let kids be kids?” Wishman asked. “It was about 120 years ago when we decided that we wanted to make sure that kids spent the majority of their time in school and not in a workplace, and especially not in a dangerous workplace.” Wishman cited research that has found serious adverse effects for teenagers working more than 20 hours a week. “These legislators don’t care about that because it’s not their kids,” he said. “This law is intended for somebody else’s kids.”",

    "author": "Martin Pengelly",
    "content": "Secret Service agents acted fast on Tuesday to capture a fast-moving White House intruder: a two-year-old boy who wriggled through fencing on the north side of the building, prompting a brief security shutdown. The Secret Service chief of communications, Anthony Guglielmi , said the “curious young visitor” gained entry “along the … north fence line [and] briefly entered White House grounds. “The White House security systems instantly triggered Secret Service officers and the toddler and parents were quickly reunited.” The boy’s parents, waiting on Pennsylvania Avenue, were briefly questioned then sent on their way. The fence the toddler squeezed through is more than 13ft high. Reporting the breach, NPR said “older children have sometimes become stuck in the iconic barrier, which has also been the scene of demonstrations, with protesters chaining themselves to the fence”. Installation of the fence began in 2019, after a number of intruders made it on to White House grounds. In the most alarming incident, in early 2017, a man carrying chemical spray scaled a 5ft fence by the US treasury department next door, then spent 16 minutes on White House grounds before being apprehended. The intruder, Jonathan Tran, was found to be carrying two cans of Mace, a passport, a computer and a book by the then president, Donald Trump. He told his arresting agents he was a friend of Trump and had an appointment. Trump, who the Tufts law professor Daniel Drezner memorably christened the Toddler in Chief , was at home at the time. He commended the Secret Service for doing “a fantastic job”.",

    "title": "Dominion’s $1.6bn trial against Fox News over election lies delayed",
    "author": "Sam Levine and Kira Lerner in Wilmington",
    "content": "The landmark $1.6bn defamation trial between Dominion Voting Systems and Fox kicked off on Tuesday morning, but was unexpectedly delayed after 12 jurors were sworn in. Related: Fox News-Dominion case heats up as Giuliani audio emerges and trial nears Both sides were expected to present their opening arguments to the jury around 1.30pm ET but when the court reconvened, Judge Eric Davis appeared on the bench, then left the courtroom with Dominion and Fox lawyers. A packed courtroom began to wonder about the delay as Justin Nelson, Dominion’s lead lawyer, and Dan Webb, one of Fox’s lead lawyers, repeatedly conferred. The trial had been already delayed a day amid settlement talks, but appeared headed towards trial on Tuesday morning. An hour before the court was set to conclude for the day, Davis had not returned to the bench. Both sides had said they planned more than an hour of opening statements. Amid the wait, Davis issued an order appointing a special master to investigate whether Fox had failed to comply with its obligation to turn over all discovery in the case, the New York Times and Washington Post reported. The special master’s report is due on 15 May. Earlier, Davis instructed the jurors and 12 alternates to avoid discussing the case or reading anything about it on the internet or social media. “Human nature is that you’re going to want to talk about the case among yourselves or with third parties,” he said. “It’s hard but you’re just going to have to fight human nature.” The diverse group of 12 people had been tasked with deciding whether Fox should be held accountable for its role in spreading lies about the 2020 election. Dominion is suing Fox News and its parent company Fox Corporation for knowingly spreading false claims about its equipment after the 2020 election. Fox repeatedly broadcast outlandishly false allegations that the company had paid government bribes, switched votes and was founded in Venezuela to rig elections for Hugo Chávez. “In the coming weeks, we will prove Fox spread lies causing enormous damage to Dominion,” said a Dominion spokesperson in a statement the morning of the trial. “We look forward to trial.” The trial has already provoked a media frenzy. On Tuesday, dozens of reporters and cameras were outside the courthouse, and the courtroom and an overflow area were packed with reporters. A Fox spokesperson was reportedly kicked out of the courtroom for taking a photograph, which is against the court rules. Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, the top Fox executives, are expected to be called as witnesses. Fox News anchors Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, Maria Bartiromo and Jeanine Pirro are expected to testify at the trial. At the heart of Dominion’s case is a trove of internal messages from Fox hosts and executives in which they openly say they knew the outlandish claims about Dominion were false. “Sidney Powell is lying, by the way. I caught her. It’s insane,” Carlson wrote in one such message, even as Fox continued to air Powell’s claims about Dominion. Defamation cases rarely go to trial because there is such a high bar a plaintiff has to clear to win. But experts observing the lawsuit said Dominion had put together an unusually strong case. The company may have strong enough evidence to show that Fox acted with “actual malice”, that Fox knew the claims were false, or that Fox acted with reckless disregard for the truth. “It’s a rarity that we’ll see something of this caliber play out in front of a jury,” said RonNell Andersen Jones, a first amendment scholar at the University of Utah. The case could also have broader implications for media in the US. Fox has said that a win for Dominion would be a blow for the first amendment. Some experts have expressed similar concerns. Many news organizations may not be able to afford the lengthy legal battle that Fox can, said Jane Kirtley, a professor at the University of Minnesota and former executive director for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. “The risk of big-money judgments deters investigative journalism. Unfortunately, I’d predict [that] if Fox loses, we’ll see a significant uptick in libel cases against all news organizations,” she said. “Most news organizations will have a digital paper trail, which, though perhaps not as damning as Fox’s, could indicate (at least in a jury’s mind) bias, irreverence, carelessness and so forth.” But other experts see it differently. If Dominion were to prevail in the case, it could show that news organizations can still be held accountable despite the high bar plaintiffs must clear. If Fox were to prevail in the case, some say, it would be difficult to imagine what a plaintiff would need to show to prove a defamation claim. Judge Davis issued a series of pre-trial rulings limiting what Fox can argue in its defense. Fox may spend a significant portion of the trial focused on the idea that the specific individuals responsible for airing the challenged claims did not know they were false. The network could also focus its defense on challenging the $1.6bn in damages Dominion says it is owed. Related: Judge signals plan to appoint special master in Fox News-Dominion case But Fox is facing increasing hurdles. The network apologized on Friday for failing to disclose Rupert Murdoch’s position as an officer at Fox News until last week, telling Davis on Friday there was a “ misunderstanding ”. Abby Grossberg, a former Fox News employee, is also suing the network, claiming she was coerced into giving misleading testimony. She also has made public new recordings in which Rudy Giuliani and Trump campaign officials say they cannot substantiate fraud allegations. “As counsel explained to the court, Fox produced the supplemental information from Ms Grossberg when we first learned it,” a Fox spokesperson said in a statement. “Rupert Murdoch has been listed as executive chairman of Fox News in our SEC filings for several years, and this filing was referenced by Dominion’s own attorney during his deposition.” The company is facing a lawsuit from a shareholder who says the Murdochs and other officials breached their fiduciary duty by allowing false claims to be aired. A Fox spokesperson noted that viewership data “has not been impacted by the Dominion case” and has been steady or increased since the start of the trial process in mid-February.",

    "title": "Women’s Institute will ‘continue to celebrate’ transgender women amid inclusivity row",
    "author": "Alexandra Topping",
    "content": "The Women’s Institute will continue to “celebrate” the lives of the transgender women enriching its membership, the head of the organisation said on Tuesday, following reports that it was facing a bid to overturn inclusive policy. Melissa Green, CEO of the the National Federation of Women’s Institutes (NFWI), said the organisation did not want to enter into a “toxic and divisive” row that sought to sow discord among women, but instead foster sensible discourse and reflect the lives of all its members – including those that are transgender. “Being part of the WI is about the experience of being a woman, and that is a combination of both biology and lived experience,” she said in an interview with the Guardian. “For us, transgender women are women and we want to share and celebrate their experience with them. I know from speaking to so many of our members that they feel that we are enriched by that, that we learn something about being a woman through the eyes of transgender women.” Green downplayed reports that the WI is facing a revolt from an internal group which is pushing for it to overturn a policy – in place since the 70s and made official in 2015 – which allows transgender members to join the organisation, saying the majority of members were supportive of its stance. The Women’s Institute Declaration group – which states that the WI’s inclusivity policy is “damaging the WI’s reputation and ability to campaign on women’s issues” – is calling for a moratorium on transgender women joining the WI and says it should “focus on women as a biological sex class, rather than as an individual expression of gender”. Green said the organisation had no plans to review the policy. “We’re not an organisation that sort of stuck in one place – we’re constantly evolving and reviewing opposition and making sure we’re relevant to women in the 21st century,” she said. “So there are no plans to review this policy – which is not new – because we’ve received no communication suggesting that that’s what our members want.” Green said the WI was populated by “well-informed, strong minded women who debate the big issues of the day” and would not stifle debate. “We’ve got a very strong democratic process,” she said. “When we have an issue, we talk about it and we have a process. We don’t let ourselves get caught up in this kind of external panic around things because our members already have a route to share their views and their thoughts with us.” On Tuesday former Conservative leader William Hague supported the WI’s position when questioned about the topic on Times Radio, saying: “[T]here are transgender people, they have changed their gender. This is part of our society now […] And I think large national organisations like the WI have to get over that and get used to that, and welcome new people.” But Green said the WI had only received two direct emails about the row on Tuesday, one from a non-member to express disgust and one from a member who had urged the organisation’s leaders not to change the inclusive stance of “our wonderful progressive community”. The WI – the largest voluntary women’s organisation in the UK – featured trans woman Petra Wenham and her wife, Loraine, on the cover of its magazine in 2021. “We’ve had an incredible outpouring of support for Petra, and for our policy position so we feel confident that it’s a strong position,” said Green. “I know from speaking to many transgender women who are members of ours that they feel overwhelmed by the love, support and fellowship they’re offered by WI members through what is often a very difficult journey for them.” The WI – despite its reputation as a bastion of Middle England – has a long history of taking progressive, and sometimes controversial, stances. It campaigned on venereal disease in 1922, calling for full, free family planning in 1972, and demanding the prohibition of female genital mutilation in 1983. “We’ve not been afraid to tackle things that cause us or other people discomfort in an effort to inform and educate and move society forward,” said Green. “Since 1915 we’ve been a group of well-informed, strong-minded women who debate the big things of the day and this just happens to be one of them. We’re not always going to agree on everything. I don’t know why anybody would expect us to.”",

    "author": "Martin Pengelly",
    "content": "Donald Trump returned to Instagram on Tuesday, posting for the first time since 5 January 2021, the day before the former US president incited the deadly attack on Congress which led to his suspension from major social media platforms. Related: Chris Christie derides Ron DeSantis for being outfoxed by Disney Trump, who is now running to regain the White House, used his return to Instagram to promote a second edition of his digital trading cards, a project widely mocked when he announced it in December but which sold out an edition of 44,000 in less than a day, netting $4.5m. Trump has already enjoyed a fundraising boost this month, centered on his criminal indictment in New York on 34 charges of falsification of business records, all relating to his hush money payment to Stormy Daniels, an adult film star who claims an affair. The parent company of Instagram and Facebook, Meta, lifted its ban on Trump in January. Meta’s president of global affairs, the former British deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, said then there would be “new guardrails in place to deter repeat offenses”. “In the event that Mr Trump posts further violating content,” Clegg said, “the content will be removed and he will be suspended for between one month and two years, depending on the severity of the violation.” On Tuesday, Trump’s first post back on Instagram announced the second series of cards alongside an image of him holding the Liberty Bell against a sunset and the Stars and Stripes. In his second post, a picture of himself as a superhero in red spandex and wearing the US flag as a cape, Trump wrote : “I hope everyone notices, and I’m sure the Fake News won’t, that I’m leaving the price of the Trading Cards the same as last time.” He also claimed he “could have raised the price MUCH HIGHER, and I believe it still would have sold well, with a lot more money coming to me, but I didn’t choose to do so. I WILL BE GIVEN NO ‘NICE GUY’ CREDIT?” Elon Musk, the owner of Twitter, lifted its Trump ban in November. Trump has not returned, instead using Truth Social, the platform he set up after January 6. As well as the New York indictment, Trump faces legal jeopardy over the events of January 6, his election subversion, his handling of classified material, his business affairs and an allegation of rape. Denying all wrongdoing, he remains the clear leader in polling regarding the Republican nomination for president. Trump’s last Instagram post before his ban was an announcement of his speech near the White House on 6 January 2021. The House January 6 committee has shown that Trump knew members of the crowd were armed, but still told supporters to march on the Capitol and “fight like hell” to overturn his election defeat. Mark Bowden and Matt Teague, authors of The Steal : The Attempt to Overturn the 2020 Election and the People Who Stopped It, contend that the rioters “had no more chance of overthrowing the US government than hippies in 1967 had trying to levitate the Pentagon ”. But nine deaths are now linked to the riot, including law enforcement suicides. Trump was impeached a second time, for inciting an insurrection. Escaping conviction, as enough Republican senators stayed loyal, he remains eligible to return to the Oval Office.",

    "title": "French publisher arrested in London on terrorism charge",
    "author": "Matthew Weaver",
    "content": "A French publisher has been arrested on terror charges in London after being questioned by UK police about participating in anti-government protests in France. Ernest Moret, 28, a foreign rights manager for Éditions la Fabrique, was approached by two plainclothes officers at St Pancras station on Monday evening after arriving by train from Paris to attend the London book fair. He was questioned for six hours and then arrested for alleged obstruction in refusing to disclose the passcodes to his phone and computer. His treatment was condemned as an attack on the right to demonstrate, amid calls for protests outside the UK embassy in Paris and the French Institute in London. Moret arrived at St Pancras at 7.15pm with his colleague Stella Magliani-Belkacem, the editorial director at the Paris-based publishing house, to be confronted by the two officers. Magliani-Belkacem told the Guardian: “When we were on the platform, two people, a woman and a guy, told us they were counter-terrorist police. They showed a paper called section 7 of the Terrorism Act of 2000 and said they had the right to ask him about demonstrations in France.” She added: “I’m still shaking. We are in shock about what happened.” She said French publishers had drafted a joint letter calling for a protest outside the British embassy in France on Tuesday evening about Moret’s treatment. When the officers began questioning Moret, Magliani-Belkacem called her friend Sebastian Budgen, a senior editor at Verso Books in London, at whose home she and Moret had arranged to stay. Budgen arranged for a lawyer to visit Moret. The lawyer called Budgen at 1am on Tuesday to confirm that Moret had been arrested over his refusal to tell police the passcodes to his confiscated phone and laptop. He was transferred to a police station in Islington, north London, where he remained in custody on Tuesday. He was later released on bail. Éditions la Fabrique is known for publishing radical left authors. Moret also represents the French science fiction novelist Alain Damasio and had arranged more than 40 appointments at the London book fair. A joint press release from Verso Books and Éditions la Fabrique condemned Moret’s treatment as “scandalous”. It said: “The police officers claimed that Ernest had participated in demonstrations in France as a justification for this act – a quite remarkably inappropriate statement for a British police officer to make, and which seems to clearly indicate complicity between French and British authorities on this matter.” It added: “We consider these actions to be outrageous and unjustifiable infringements of basic principles of the freedom of expression and an example of the abuse of anti-terrorism laws.” The statement said a protest was planned at the French Institute in London and called on France’s ambassador to the UK, Hélène Duchêne, to request Moret’s immediate release. Budgen said: “It is causing a stink at the London book fair and there’s a big stink in France as well … there’s been an increasingly repressive approach by the French government to the demonstrations, both in terms of police violence, but also in terms of a security clampdown.” Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in France last month over Emmanuel Macron’s use of constitutional executive powers to push through an unpopular increase in the pension age . The protests caused King Charles’s planned visit to France, his first overseas tour as monarch, to be postponed. The writers’ association Pen International said it was “deeply concerned” that Moret was detained on counter-terrorism grounds. Pamela Morton, senior books and magazines organiser for the National Union of Journalists, also expressed concern. She said it seemed “extraordinary that the British police have acted this way” in arresting a publisher on the way to the London book fair. “We will be taking this up with the police,” she added. A Metropolitan police spokesperson said: “At around 7.30pm on Monday 17 April, a 28-year-old man was stopped by ports officers as he arrived at St Pancras station, using powers under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000. “On Tuesday 18 April, the man was subsequently arrested on suspicion of wilfully obstructing a schedule 7 examination, contrary to section 18 of the Terrorism Act 2000.”",

    "title": "SNP’s arrested development gives Humza Yousaf a new headache | John Crace",
    "author": "John Crace",
    "content": "You couldn’t make this stuff up. Within weeks of Nicola Sturgeon announcing her decision to step down as party leader – she was just burned out, she said – the Scottish National party has gone into total meltdown. Less the ruling party in Scotland, more like the Keystone Cops. Only it’s not entirely clear whether we’re in the middle of a farce or criminal proceedings. Perhaps both. It began with the arrest of Sturgeon’s husband, Peter Murrell , the chief executive of the SNP, at his home in Glasgow. Allegedly in connection with £600,000 of donations that may or may not have been used for day-to-day party expenses. Within hours, the front and back gardens had forensic tents erected in them and the police were reportedly digging up the patio. Everyone was tight-lipped about what the search was looking for: money? Accounts? Laptops? Bodies? Anything was possible. All we needed was Emilia Fox and the Silent Witness TV crew. Then we heard that a £100,000 motorhome had been seized from Murrell’s 90-year-old mother’s home. By now we were well through the looking-glass. Almost into Breaking Bad territory. Finally, on Tuesday, the SNP treasurer and MSP Colin Beattie was arrested as a part of the investigation into the party’s finances. He was released without charge later that day. In the midst of all this we have Humza Yousaf, the man who was narrowly elected as leader to replace Sturgeon. At the beginning of his leadership campaign, he acted as the chosen one, Nicola’s anointed successor. The man who could be trusted to protect her dreams and visions. Within a short time, it looked more and more as if Yousaf was the fall guy. Sturgeon is adamant it is just coincidence that the SNP has been caught fiddling the party membership numbers and that her husband has been investigated. In which case Yousaf is the unluckiest fall guy in Scotland. Certainly Humza does himself no favours. Not least because he has the unerring knack of making a bad situation worse. Too much more of this and some MSPs will be asking themselves if there’s a way of rerunning the leadership election to make sure Kate Forbes wins this time. Back to the Future. Shortly before giving his state of the nation address in Holyrood, Yousaf gave a brief 90-second press conference. Safe to say that every word was a car crash. “I can’t comment on a live police investigation,” he began. “It’s a very serious matter.” Though he made it sound as if we were dealing with an armed robbery or a serial shooter. Maybe that’s just how it feels to him, being constantly on the wrong end of questions he doesn’t know how to answer. “I’m always surprised when a colleague is arrested.” He really oughtn’t to be. It’s getting to be a habit. Had he suspended Beattie from the party? Yousaf looked nervously from side to side. Sweaty. On edge. Beattie was innocent until proved guilty, he grudgingly replied. He didn’t seem to realise that suspension was a neutral act. One that neither implied guilt or innocence. Just a convenient way of getting someone out the way when they have become a distraction. Who said anything about a distraction? Colin was a lovely man. Wouldn’t hurt a fly. All this was in the eyes. Would he be taking Beattie off the public audit committee? “Colin Beattie is still in the police station being questioned,” Yousaf added unnecessarily. Just in case we thought he might have been released after a few hours. “I’ll need to have a conversation with him. But not about the investigation.” Quite. That was so far above Yousaf’s pay grade. No point in him risking getting whacked by the SNP cartel. Why ask him about the one thing anyone would want to know? “I’m surprised this has happened,” he said. Like a man staring at the debris on the road after a multiple car wreck. But he was certain this wouldn’t derail his vision for the future. He would move on from this in no time. Why would a trail of arrests, some allegedly unexplained financial transactions and a brand-new motor home create a problem for his party? Weren’t all political parties regularly under investigation for similar offences? A generous person might say that Yousaf had more or less held it together. Up till now. A long way from convincing, but just about passable. Not for long. The killer question came when he was asked if the party had been operating in a criminal way while he was leader. “I don’t believe it is at all,” he said, not altogether convincingly. Because these were the unknown unknowns. He had no idea of how the SNP had been run either before or after he took over in charge. It was a mystery. He’d just taken Nicola at her word. The brief press maul had clearly unsettled Yousaf, as he plodded his way through his state of the nation address a few minutes later. There was no excitement. No verve. Little in the way of new direction. Just that a bottle deposit scheme would be postponed. His MSPs applauded politely, but you could tell they had their doubts. Both the Tories and Labour piled in, saying the SNP were out of ideas and had become mired in sleaze and criminal investigations. Humza tried to fight back, pointing out that the Tories had their own problems in those areas. Somehow that made it worse. Meanwhile, down in Westminster, nothing stirred. It’s as if Rishi Sunak is on a mission to do as little as possible. Less to go wrong that way. Today he was reannouncing the announcement on zombie-style knives for the fifth time. The biggest distraction to be found was Nadine Dorries’ new column for the Daily Mail. Though even that was dull. The Mail will be hoping to get more for their £100k than this. But then, perhaps she’s saving up her all-out assault on the MSM in the MSM for next week. Nadine and Paul Dacre can’t wait for their peerages for ever.",

    "title": "Arrest of SNP treasurer overshadows Humza Yousaf’s policy relaunch",
    "author": "Libby Brooks and Severin Carrell",
    "content": "Attempts by Scotland’s new first minister, Humza Yousaf, to stamp his authority on his already beleaguered administration were scuppered by the arrest of the Scottish National party’s treasurer hours before a major policy statement. Police Scotland said Colin Beattie, 71, the SNP MSP for Midlothian North and Musselburgh and a former banker, had been taken into custody on Tuesday morning and was being interviewed by detectives as part of an investigation into the party’s funding and finances. He was released without charge later that day, pending further investigation. The move was announced as Yousaf prepared to deliver his “fresh vision” to MSPs, setting out the policy priorities of his new government after weeks of infighting and damaging revelations. After the statement – which notably delayed, redrew or reversed a number of his predecessor Nicola Sturgeon’s key policies – opposition leaders told Yousaf that his government was “not functioning” and that any attempt at a relaunch had been “utterly torpedoed” by the arrest. Beattie’s detention follows the arrest earlier this month of Peter Murrell, who is Sturgeon’s husband and a former chief executive of the SNP, at their home in Glasgow, and the seizure of a motorhome parked outside Murrell’s mother’s house in Fife. Murrell was later released without charge pending further investigation. Yousaf told reporters at Holyrood that he would be talking to Beattie in due course about whether he would remain as party treasurer and as an SNP member of Holyrood’s public audit committee. He said Beattie’s arrest “was a very serious matter”, but added: “People are innocent until proven guilty.” Yousaf acknowledged that the timing of Tuesday’s police action was “far from ideal”, but said he did not believe that the party was operating in a criminal way. He added: “We instructed a review into transparency and good governance, and of course with the issue around financial oversight, and I want some external input into that. So there is change that is needed within how the party is operated, and I have made that absolutely clear.” Making his first significant policy statement since he was elected as SNP leader and became first minister last month, Yousaf told MSPs on Tuesday afternoon that he would delay the deposit return scheme for bottles and cans, take plans to restrict alcohol advertising “back to the drawing board”, take more time to build consensus around the planned national care service, and rejoin two international school league tables in order to increase the available comparable data on Scotland’s education performance. Announcing a delay of almost a year to the widely criticised bottle recycling scheme, Yousaf acknowledged that businesses felt their concerns had gone unheard by the previous administration, where the scheme was led by the SNP’s governing partners, the Scottish Greens, and he promised a reset of the relationship between business and government. Telling Scottish businesses directly that “my door is always open to you”, he said the three missions he was setting out – to tackle poverty, build a “fair, green and growing” economy and improve public services – all depended on a thriving business sector in Scotland. Blaming the UK government for creating uncertainty around the deposit return scheme by delaying the decision to exclude the scheme from the Internal Market Act, Yousaf announced that the launch would now be delayed until 1 March, during which time measures would be introduced to simplify the process and support small businesses and the hospitality industry. Yousaf promised to invest a further £1.3bn in the Scottish child payment over the next three years and said he would be even bolder on redistributive taxation, as he repeated his campaign pledge to convene an anti-poverty summit, inviting experts and those with lived experienced as well as opposition colleagues. The Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, dismissed the statement as “rehashed promises from the past that have never been delivered”. He said: “What Humza Yousaf can’t escape from is that he is not now running a functioning government. This is an SNP that is mired in scandal, mired in division, talking to themselves and about themselves.” The Scottish Liberal Democrats’ leader, Alex Cole-Hamilton, said: “Everyone, including those SNP backbenchers otherwise engaged today, knows this first minister’s relaunch has been utterly torpedoed. And while he is focused on the turmoil within his own party, NHS waiting time targets are still being missed, more ferries are breaking down, and record amounts of sewage are being dumped into Scotland’s rivers.”",

    "title": "Pep Guardiola calls on Manchester City to ‘punish’ Bayern Munich in second leg",
    "author": "Jamie Jackson in Munich",
    "content": "Pep Guardiola has urged Manchester City not to dwell on previous Champions League exits and to try to “punish” Bayern Munich in the quarter-final second leg on Wednesday despite their 3-0 advantage. \n City were far superior in the opening game at the Etihad Stadium last week, goals from Rodri, Bernardo Silva and Erling Haaland making them favourites to progress to the semi-final. Yet before that match and when Leipzig were beaten 7-0 in the previous round, Guardiola brought up how by conceding a “lot of goals” against Real Madrid, Tottenham and Monaco these sides eliminated City in previous years. \n The manager was asked how he could be sure that these and other similar knockouts – by Liverpool and Lyon – would not be on his players’ minds at Allianz Arena on Wednesday. “We can’t think about the past – that’d be a big mistake for us – so we just prepare for this game,” he said. \n \n Related: Manchester City plan to add 7,000 seats, museum and hotel to Etihad Stadium \n \n Guardiola referenced how the 1-0 deficit to Tottenham in 2019 in a quarter-final opening leg became a 4-4 aggregate defeat on away goals. “It was completely different – we were down,” he said. \n “Our mindset will be to prepare for the [Bayern] game by watching the first leg, seeing what we could do better, and how we can control the game and punish them. \n “We are here in Munich against one of the most historical sides in the Champions League – we are not here to defend something [the lead]. It’s 11 men against 11 and try to be better than the opponent in this specific game. Our mindset is to try and win the game.” \n Guardiola was asked if City will handle the contest if they concede first. “I would like to say yes but I don’t know. Each game is different,” he said. “The pace they have up front is unbelievable. We can’t press in the same way all the time as they have the weapons to understand how we do it. If we do all this stuff, we will win, but I don’t know what will happen.” \n Guardiola has Phil Foden available again following an emergency operation for appendicitis. “It’s good news for us. He had one training session so he will be on the bench. I don’t know [how many minutes he is capable of] – but he’s special, he doesn’t need a lot of training sessions to be fit.” \n Like his manager, Ilkay Gündogan offered a cautious note. “It’s about finding a balance – our team is about starting every game with a view to winning it. We want the ball, possession, to win – but we need to play in a mature way,” the Germany midfielder said. \n “We know from our own games and experiences in the past, everything is possible. You can get incredible results that you won’t believe beforehand so we take it very seriously.” \n Gündogan’s contract expires in the close season. “There are talks in the background – that’s normal with a couple of months left,” he said. “There’s nothing decided yet, not from my side, not from the club’s side – the talks continue. My physical condition – that also plays a part in [whether to leave].” \n Thomas Tuchel admitted that his team must believe they can still progress. “We need a miracle,” Bayern’s head coach said. “It’s the second part of the tie and we have to play two more halves [on Wednesday]. If we play the good first half, it can happen in the second. Everything is possible – we are aware of this. \n \n Related: Manchester City gain edge in title race as Arsenal wobble – Football Weekly \n \n “If the moment comes and we have luck then everything is possible in football. But there are moments, periods, important decisions by the referee, offsides, chances that are saved: all these things come together. We need to find the belief in us, but that doesn’t mean we dream. \n “It’s hard, and it’s a huge mountain to climb. We need to believe – we believe in ourselves but we don’t want to be dreamers – dreaming for me is close to sleeping and if you cannot do one thing, you cannot sleep for one second. We need to believe and make it happen by performance, team spirit and energy.” \n Tuchel, who may start Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting at centre-forward, will have Sadio Mané available again following his one-game suspension for hitting Leroy Sané in the Bayern changing room at the Eithad Stadium after the first leg last week.",

    "author": "Nina Lakhani",
    "content": "Amnesty International has launched a new campaign calling on Joe Biden to grant clemency for Leonard Peltier, the Indigenous rights activist whose health is deteriorating after almost five decades in maximum security prison for crimes he has always denied. The international human rights group is urging Biden to release Peltier on humanitarian grounds – exactly 46 years after he was convicted for killing two FBI agents in a trial rife with irregularities and due process violations including evidence that the agency coerced witnesses and withheld and falsified evidence. Related: Former Navajo Nation leader Peterson Zah dies at age 85 “No one should be locked up, let alone for over 40 years, when there are serious concerns about the fairness of their trial. President Biden should right this historic wrong and grant Leonard Peltier clemency,” said Zeke Johnson, Amnesty International US national director of campaigns. Peltier, an enrolled member of the Turtle Mountain Chippewa tribe and of Lakota and Dakota descent, was convicted of murdering FBI agents Jack Coler and Ronald Williams during a shootout on the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota in June 1975. Peltier was a leader of the American Indian Movement (AIM), an Indigenous civil rights movement founded in Minneapolis that was infiltrated and repressed by the FBI. Now 78, Peltier is currently held in a maximum security prison in Coleman, Florida, where his health and mobility have significantly deteriorated since contracting Covid-19. Amnesty International, who had observers at the original trial, is among a long list of advocates to call for Peltier’s release since his conviction in 1977 – including a group of UN arbitrary detention experts and the US attorney James Reynolds, whose team led the prosecution and appeal of Peltier’s case. Earlier this year, former agent Coleen Rowley became the first FBI insider to call for clemency, after claiming that the agency’s stubborn opposition to Peltier’s release was driven by vindictiveness. The agency has continuously campaigned and protested against his parole and clemency. Peltier is not eligible for parole again until 2024; the most recent petition for clemency was submitted by his legal team in 2021, but remains unresolved. In an exclusive interview with the Guardian conducted via email in February, Peltier said: “Being free to me means being able to breathe freely away from the many dangers I live under in maximum custody prison. Being free would mean I could walk over a mile straight. It would mean being able to hug my grandchildren and great-grandchildren.”",

    "title": "Surrey and Sussex police unlawfully recorded phone calls via app, watchdog finds",
    "author": "Ben Quinn",
    "content": "Two police forces have been reprimanded by Britain’s data watchdog after officers unlawfully recorded more than 200,000 phone conversations using an app originally intended for hostage negotiators. The automatic recordings, made over several years, included “highly sensitive” conversations with victims, witnesses and perpetrators of suspected crimes, according to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). The app, called Another Call Recorder (ACR), recorded all incoming and outgoing calls and was originally intended for use by a small number of officers at Surrey and Sussex forces. However, it was downloaded on to the work phones of more than 1,000 staff members. It has now been withdrawn from use and the recordings, other than those considered to be evidential material, have been destroyed, according to the ICO. The watchdog said it considered issuing a £1m fine to both forces but opted for the reprimand to reduce the impact on public services. Police officers that downloaded the app were unaware all calls would be recorded, the watchdog said, and people were not informed their conversations were being taped. The forces said in a joint statement that the app was made available for use in 2017 by a small number of specialist hostage negotiators for the purpose of supporting kidnap and crisis negotiations and maximising public safety. “There was no means at that time of restricting use of the app and, unintentionally, it was enabled for all staff to download without appropriate guidance in place. When enabled, the app records and stores all phone calls made in the mobile device,” they said. Individuals whose data was recorded have not been contacted because the forces received directions to delete the calls. Katie Wheatley, a partner and head of the crime, fraud and regulatory team at Bindmans law firm, said it appeared that only recordings identified by the police as relevant were passed to lawyers at the Crown Prosecution Service for review before it was concluded that “only” one could have had an impact if the case had gone to trial. “It is not clear precisely how the recordings were assessed for relevance by police users during the audit or what information or guidance they were provided with to make an assessment,” she said. “No one else will now be able to review any recordings that were not passed to the CPS as it appears all recordings have now been deleted. Usually material will be reviewed by a disclosure officer assigned to the case, and also prosecution lawyers. The reason why disclosure is so vital is it enables defendants to have access to material which may undermine the case against them or which might assist their defence, and so non-disclosure risks miscarriages of justice.” An internal audit was carried out to establish the number of officers and staff who downloaded the app, the extent to which they used it and the quantity and nature of any material which may have been recorded, the forces said. It was established that the app was used on 432 phones and that those phones held audio files. They said the audit also established that 1,024 officers and staff had downloaded the app. Three users had recordings that related to criminal cases, but it was concluded that only one could have had a potential impact if the case progressed to trial. Fiona Macpherson, the temporary assistant chief constable at Sussex police, described the case as “regrettable”. “As soon as the error was reported, we took urgent action to ensure that this did not happen again. We initiated a review of all applications available on the corporate Google Play Store to ensure that there are no other applications that may have had similar functionality. A robust process is now in place to ensure any new requests for mobile apps are subject to appropriate due diligence and scrutiny,” she said. Stephen Bonner, the ICO deputy commissioner, said: “People have the right to expect that when they speak to a police officer, the information they disclose is handled responsibly. “We can only estimate the huge amount of personal data collected during these conversations, including highly sensitive information relating to suspected crimes.” He added that the reprimand reflected the use of the ICO’s wider powers towards the public sector, as large fines could lead to reduced budgets for the provision of vital services. “This case highlights why the ICO is pursuing a different approach, as fining Surrey police and Sussex police risks affecting the victims of crime in the area once again,” he said. “This case should be a lesson learned to any organisation planning to introduce an app, product or service that uses people’s personal data. “Organisations must consider people’s data protection rights and implement data protection principles from the very start.” The ICO recommended both forces take action to ensure they complied with data protection law, including considering data protection at the start of any deployment of new apps and issuing data protection guidance to staff. The forces have been told to report back to the ICO within three months to explain how they have addressed its concerns and recommendations.",

    "title": "Michael Lipton obituary",
    "author": "Simon Maxwell",
    "content": "The development economist Michael Lipton, who has died aged 86, credited an important part of his education to the people of the village of Kavathe in Maharashtra state, India. His research there in 1965-66 anchored a lifetime devoted to understanding, explaining and advocating for poor rural people around the world. Rather than being backward and conservative as some supposed, such communities acted rationally and managed resources efficiently. In his paper The Theory of the Optimising Peasant (1968), Michael explained that poor, small farmers were often reluctant to adopt new varieties of wheat and rice such as those rolled out in the green revolution of the mid-20th century, despite the average yield being higher than that of traditional varieties. This was because when the new varieties failed, because of drought or disease, they did so more spectacularly than traditional varieties, and thus increased the risk of hunger and destitution. When later generations of the green revolution crops reduced the risk, poor farmers adopted them with enthusiasm. Michael also showed that in land-scarce situations, poor farmers managed the land more intensively and more efficiently than richer ones; and he debunked the idea that poor farmers were wasteful, showing that grain losses on farms were often minimal. These ideas helped overturn the idea that national development could only come via industrialisation, at the expense, usually via high taxation, of rural areas. Michael’s big book, Why Poor People Stay Poor: Urban Bias and World Development (1977), set out to map in detail the ways in which urban-focused elites and policymakers discriminated against the rural poor. In other work, Michael crossed the boundaries of disciplines to explore the linkages between agriculture, health and nutrition. In a short book for the World Health Organisation with Emanuel de Kadt , Agriculture-Health Linkages (1988), the authors demonstrated how the health and nutrition of rural people were shaped by agricultural policy: what was grown, at what price, and where. They showed how to make agricultural policymaking and institutions more responsive to the health needs of poor people, especially women, in rural areas. Michael’s interest in development economics was sparked by Paul Streeten at Oxford, and by research for Gunnar Myrdal, author of what eventually became Asian Drama: An Inquiry Into the Poverty of Nations (1968). In 1966 he married Merle Babrow, a historian and political analyst from South Africa, and they shared a long-term interest in rural development and social change there. The countries he advised included India and Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Sudan, Botswana and South Africa. He worked with banks, aid agencies and foundations, and in 2001 was the main author of the first Rural Poverty report for the International Fund for Agricultural Development. Characteristic of his initiatives were market-based approaches to land reform in southern Africa, seeking to overturn the historic inequity of land appropriation by colonial interests while avoiding violent conflict. Born in London, Michael was the son of Helen and Leslie Lipton, émigrés from Hamburg. From Haberdashers’ school, then in Hampstead, he went on to Balliol College, Oxford, where he gained a first in philosophy, politics and economics (1960), and to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was an elected fellow of All Souls, Oxford (1961-68 and 1983-84), and held professorial posts at both the Institute of Development Studies in Brighton and at the University of Sussex. He was founding director of the university’s Poverty Research Unit (1994-97), now the Centre for Poverty and Inequality Research . He also had attachments with the World Bank and the International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington, where he was director of the consumption and nutrition division (1987-89). In 2003 Michael was appointed CMG; in 2006 he was elected a fellow of the British Academy; and in 2012 he won the Leontief prize, for contributions to economic theory that address contemporary realities and support just and sustainable societies. He was devoted to his family, and to classical music, running and chess. On the last of these, he published a number of books, including the co-authored The Two-Move Chess Problem (1966), and Collected Chess Problems of Michael Lipton (2016). From 2000 to 2002 he was president of the British Chess Problem Society. In his professional relationships Michael was rigorous and uncompromising, but he was also hospitable, generous and sympathetic. Merle died in 2022 . Michael is survived by his son, Emanuel, and his grandson, Joshua. • Michael Lipton, development economist, born 13 February 1937; died 1 April 2023",

    "title": "Why Rishi Sunak may be the most socially conservative PM of his generation",
    "author": "Jessica Elgot",
    "content": "It was one of the many strange quirks of the summer Tory leadership contest: that Liz Truss captured the mantle of the true blue Conservative while Rishi Sunak found himself painted as a wet, Cameronite liberal. But in the past five months of his premiership, that portrayal of Sunak has started to become laughable. He is perhaps the most socially conservative prime minister of his generation, more so than Truss, Boris Johnson or even Theresa May. Both his predecessors were happy to play to the Tory gallery on culture wars but Johnson as London mayor was a liberal on immigration and gay rights, and Truss was a stalwart at LGBTQ+ Conservative events, and as a student campaigned on drug legalisation. May, who took a draconian approach to migration at the Home Office, also took a strong stance against stop and search, modern slavery and backed a ban on trans conversion practices. There has been a tendency to see Sunak’s focus on issues such as trans rights , grooming gangs and small boats as politically expedient ways for the formerly California-dwelling technocrat to win over his party. Those close to him say that is demonstrably untrue. Far from being convenient red meat to the Tory members in the leadership election, his views on social issues such as gender, drugs, crime and migration are deeply conservative. Sunak is said to be personally driven, in particular on the Equality Act and trans rights. He has taken a direct interest in Kemi Badenoch’s drive to change the Equality Act to allow organisations to bar trans women from single-sex spaces and events, including hospital wards and sports. It would redefine sex in the 2010 act to specifically refer to legal protections for “biological sex”. No 10 sources have pointed out that was a formal pledge from Sunak from his leadership campaign, as well as one to review sex education material in schools. But, strikingly, it is one of the few pledges from that campaign that has survived. Others, such as fines for missing GP appointments, have been unceremoniously discarded. There have been a number of other examples. Sunak gambled on vetoing Nicola Sturgeon’s gender recognition reform bill, and the prime minister is also thought to be taking a keen interest in the new guidance being considered for schools this term on transgender pupils, which would tell single-sex schools they cannot be obliged to admit trans students . The number of pupils to which it will apply is likely to be negligible – but it is the talk of certain circles since it was raised by the Girls’ Day School Trust, which runs 25 educational facilities in England and Wales. Sunak’s daughters attend single-sex private schools. The key area Sunak is exercised about is the rights of parents to be kept informed by the school on whether their child is questioning their gender identity, a move that some LGBTQ+ charities have said children may be keeping from their parents for good reason if they believe they are at risk from their own families. But both Sunak and the education secretary, Gillian Keegan, are said to be determined that much higher regard is given to parental involvement and consent when it comes to pronouns, gender identity and sex education. It is not just trans rights, which has become the unfortunate main battleground of the culture wars, where Sunak is demonstrating his deep social conservatism. He has made “stopping the boats” one of his five priorities and is set to make it virtually impossible for refugees to seek asylum in the UK apart from through an extremely narrow set of country-specific routes. Again, this is not just the personal drive of Suella Braverman but of Sunak himself. Braverman, sacked just hours previously by Truss, was restored as home secretary as a price for backing Sunak’s succession – or so it was said. She was variably described as the shield behind which Sunak could hide his more liberal persuasions. That, again, now seems demonstrably untrue. Sunak has been at the forefront of Braverman’s drive on grooming gangs – and although seemingly unwilling to echo her language, he has never disavowed it. It is another of the few pledges from his leadership campaign to have survived. He also becomes obviously personally exercised on the subject of illegal drugs and is enthusiastic about banning nitrous oxide , calling the cannisters a “scourge” and promising a zero-tolerance approach. Sunak may well reap some electoral rewards by trying to straddle both wings of the Conservative party – leaning into his social conservatism, which is more in line with the perceived average traditional Conservative voter, and then advantaged in Liberal Democrat-leaning seats by being – wrongly – seen as a liberal. Of course, the risk is that his enthusiasm for the culture wars backfires in the blue wall, while the economy tanks him in the “red wall”.",

    "author": "Aubrey Allegretti Political correspondent",
    "content": "Conservatives who want to railroad through measures to curb small boat crossings by pulling the UK out of the European convention on human rights (EHRC) could make a “tactical retreat” and instead lobby for a commitment in the party’s next manifesto. Some of those who put their name to a rebel amendment to the illegal migration bill, which is due to go through its final parliamentary stages next Tuesday, told the Guardian a climbdown was possible. Instead of pushing for the bill to explicitly allow ministers and the UK courts to ignore interim injunctions obstructing plans to speed up the removal of migrants, they may instead set their eyes on exploiting the issue as a dividing line with Labour at the next election. Sources inside the group said they may be prepared to not press the matter, after being invited to breakfast at Downing Street by Rishi Sunak on Tuesday and given personal assurances. The Home Office is due to publish its own amendments to the bill on Thursday, and the immigration minister, Robert Jenrick, held talks with one of the rebel ringleaders, Danny Kruger, on Tuesday afternoon. Final decisions are not believed to have been taken about the amendments, with jostling going down to the wire over any clause about the removals going ahead “notwithstanding” any judgments by the EHRC. There are also discussions about potential compromises over other possible Tory amendments, including creating more safe and legal routes for asylum seekers. In a meeting with the Common Sense Group of Tory MPs on Tuesday, the prime minister was said to have resisted committing to ignore rulings from judges in Strasbourg, which have led to the Rwanda removals plan being stalled. But according to several of those present, he told them he had “skin in the game, too” and was staking his own premiership on an unequivocal commitment to stop the boats. He is said to have stressed the illegal migration bill was already tough, and urged against Tory disunity by pointing to the narrowing in the opinion polls and threat that any rebellion may pose to the party’s performance in the local elections. Several prospective rebels were sympathetic but said they expected him not to give in to any attempts by other groups of Tory MPs to “weaken” the bill – for instance by adding exemptions for people who claim to be victims of modern slavery. “We’re not going to be told to get back into our cage only for the other side to get their own concessions,” said one. Another added: “This might be our final shot – the last proper vehicle to get our immigration system sorted out before the next election. We want to hold the government’s feet to the fire.” Some are relaxed about the possibility of Kruger’s potential rebels pushing their amendment, given the impossibility of such a motion passing without cross-party support. “They’re a paper tiger,” said one senior government source. “The real concern is on amendments that could stand the chance of attracting support from the Labour party.” They pointed to those such as one proposed by Tim Loughton to improve safe and legal routes. All authorised leave for Tory MPs is said to have been cancelled next Tuesday, in a sign that the whips’ office expects there could be some tight votes. It came as the number of people who reached the UK in small boats this year hit 5,000, with 113 arriving in three vessels on Monday, taking the total since the start of the year to 5,049. By the same date in 2022 the number was higher at 6,300. The figures were used by Downing Street to argue that some recent measures – such as boosting work with the French government to increase interceptions in the Channel – were helping to reduce crossings. Sunak’s spokesperson said ending the crossings significantly would take time and require an “incremental approach”. They added it was “too early to draw conclusions at this stage” to pinpoint the effect of specific policies, “given we know the impact the weather can have on weekly, even daily, crossings”. However, Labour used the figures to renew its attacks on the Conservatives’ “failure” to stem the crossings despite the promised Rwanda removal plan. Since the £140m partnership was signed on 14 April 2022, 44,976 people have arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel in small boats. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, accused the prime minister of failing to “tackle the criminal gangs or sort out the chaos in the asylum system” and instead offering only “rhetoric and gimmicks”. She pointed to Sunak’s recent refusal to stand by his commitment to stop the boats by the next general election, and said Labour would set up returns arrangements with Europe and overhaul resettlement schemes.",

    "title": "‘I do not regret a thing’: Wagner fighter admits torturing Ukrainian troops and PoWs ",
    "author": "Pjotr Sauer",
    "content": "A former Wagner mercenary has admitted to killing and torturing dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war, in one of the most detailed first-person accounts of atrocities committed by Russian forces in Ukraine. Alexey Savichev, 49, a former Russian convict recruited by Wagner last September, told the Guardian in a telephone interview that he participated in summary executions of Ukrainian prisoners of war during his six months of fighting in eastern Ukraine. “We were told not to take any prisoners, and just shoot them on the spot,” he said. In one instance, while fighting near the eastern Ukrainian city of Soledar last autumn, Savichev said he participated in the killings of 20 Ukrainian soldiers who were surrounded. “We sprayed them with our bullets,” he said. “It is war and I do not regret a single thing I did there. If I could, I would go back.” Savichev said that in another episode, with other Wagner fighters he had killed “several dozen” injured Ukrainian PoWs by “tossing grenades” into the ditch where they were held near the city Bakhmut in January. “We would torture soldiers too, there weren’t any rules,” he said. Savichev’s account was first published on Monday by the Gulagu.net rights group in an hour an 17 minute-long video, where he appeared alongside another former Wagner fighter, identified as Azamat Uldarov, who also said he had killed civilians, including children, during the battle for Bakhmut. Uldarov said his fellow mercenaries in one instance killed a group of people who had taken shelter in the basement of a nine-floor block of flats in Bakhmut, including a young girl. “She was screaming, she was a little kid, she was five or six and I shot her, a kill shot. I wasn’t allowed to let anyone out, you understand?” Uldarov told Vladimir Osechkin, the head of the Gulagu.net rights group. He could not be reached for comment. The Guardian cannot independently verify either man’s harrowing claim but has seen Russian penal documents showing that Savichev, who was a convicted murderer, was released from a prison in Voronezh, a city in south-west Russia, on a presidential pardon on 12 September. Wagner has recruited tens of thousands of inmates, including convicted murderers, to fight in eastern Ukraine. They were offered freedom if they survived a near-suicidal six-month stint, one Savichev completed on 12 March. Savichev also provided the Guardian with photographs of two medals that he said he received for the battle of Soledar, a town in eastern Ukraine that Wagner troops captured in early January. His testimony appears to contribute towards a mounting body of evidence that sheds light on the war crimes committed by Russian soliders in Ukraine. Earlier this month, two videos emerged showing Russian soldiers apparently beheading Ukrainian prisoners of war. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the world could not ignore the “evil” footage, which has not been verified by the Guardian. “How easily these beasts kill. We are not going to forget anything. Neither are we going to forgive the murderers,” he said. Responding to the interview published by Gulagu Net, Zelensky’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said those responsible should be punished. “Confession is not enough. There must be a punishment. Tough and fair. And it will definitely be,” Yermak wrote on Twitter. Since the start of the war, a number of Russian soldiers, including one former Wagner convict, have fled abroad and described witnessing Russian war crimes, but Savichev’s testimony is a rare account of a former Wagner soldier still in Russia. Savichev said he has been on the run since giving his first interview on Monday and had received “multiple” threats. Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of Wagner, said the account of the two former Wagner soldiers was a “flagrant lie” and that Wagner fighters “have never touched and do not touch” children. Savichev said he feared he would face the same consequence as Yevgeny Nuzhin , a convicted murderer recruited by Wagner who surrendered to Ukrainian forces but was later handed over to Russia and executed. “I was with Wagner, and know what they can do to those who speak out,” Savichev said. “I understand I could die soon. I just don’t want my death to be violent.” He said he had witnessed multiple summary killings of other Wagner fighters accused by their commanders of disobeying orders or of breaking the “code of conduct”, including regarding the consumption of alcohol. Savichev said he joined Wagner after Prigozhin visited his IK-12 colony in Voronezh last September. “Prigozhin came to our prison and said that he was looking for killers. He said the regular army was full of wussies who couldn’t get the job done.” He said he was accepted into Wagner despite his HIV diagnosis – Russia’s regular army does not permit soldiers with serious diseases to join its ranks. “They don’t care if you have HIV or hepatitis, as long as you can kill,” he said. According to Savichev’s account, just over 100 prisoners from IK-12 in Voronezh signed up to fight with Wagner. After a two-week training course, he was sent to the frontlines, fighting first in Soledar and, after the town’s capture, in Bakhmut. He said he was placed in small units of four that were used as “storming troops”, who were ordered to launch extremely dangerous assaults on Ukraine’s positions. He estimated that of the 100 prisoners recruited from his prison, only 21 returned alive. According to western estimates, Wagner has suffered more than 30,000 casualties, mostly former convicts, since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine last February. “We were basically just meat for our commanders, I still don’t know how I survived,” Savichev said. “No one gave a shit about us.”",

    "content": "First they turned upon Omar al-Bashir, the strongman they had served, when the Sudanese people rose up against the president. Then, in a coup , they turned upon the civilian politicians who had risen to power subsequently. Now they have turned upon each other . Many feared that Sudan’s General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the de facto leader and army chief, and Lt Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo , the vice-president who controls the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces and is known as Hemedti, would soon clash . But the explosion of violence last weekend, its scale and the rapidity with which it spread across the country, including to Darfur and eastern border regions, was nonetheless shocking and frightening. Both men have a grim track record, playing leading roles in the brutal counterinsurgency campaign against rebels in Darfur, with the conduct of the RSF particularly notorious. The current conflict between them was triggered by plans to integrate Hemedti’s RSF – fostered by Mr Bashir as a counterweight to the army – into the regular military, under controversial plans supposed to bring about the country’s return to civilian rule following 2021’s coup. The two men appear to regard their fight as a matter of survival . Hemedti said that General Burhan would “die like any dog” if not brought to justice. The army has declared Hemedti a “wanted criminal”. Meanwhile, terrified families have sheltered at home as the conflict rages around them, trapped without water or power and with dwindling food supplies. More than 180 people have been killed and 1,800 wounded, hospitals have come under attack, essential services have been cut and the World Food Programme has suspended desperately needed assistance after three of its employees were killed. Reports of a possible 24-hour ceasefire on Tuesday raised tentative hopes of a respite. But there is little sign that either side is willing to relinquish violence. General Burhan has long enjoyed Egypt’s backing. Hemedti is supported by the United Arab Emirates and has ties to Russia’s Wagner group. Saudi Arabia has also taken a close interest. Should the violence continue, the very real danger is that a growing number of domestic and foreign actors will be sucked in, making it harder than ever to resolve. Beyond concerns for Sudan itself are fears that fighting could spill over into Chad, Central African Republic and other parts of the region. An end to the fighting would be the first step. United and sustained international support for a ceasefire is needed. Under Donald Trump, the US effectively outsourced Sudan policy to regional players. Its re-engagement is overdue and welcome. Carefully targeted sanctions could play a role. The senior delegation that the African Union has promised might help ease the path of negotiations. Once again, avaricious and power-hungry men have trampled upon the needs and wishes of Sudanese people. This outbreak has left pro-democracy activists further than ever from their goals, reorienting efforts from politics to meeting their compatriots’ basic needs and seeking to end violence. Hemedti has portrayed himself as a protector of the 2019 revolution and some civilian leaders have, unenthusiastically, seen him as a possible defence against dictatorship under General Burhan. Yet the people are more politically conscious and organised than they have ever been, and for many at the grassroots, the last few days have confirmed that a shallow political process in a system dominated by two warlords cannot bring progress or even stability. Even in these grim times, those who have fought bravely and persistently to be heard will not abandon their ambitions.",

    "title": "The Guardian view on England’s east wetlands: wild, beautiful and vital | Editorial",
    "author": "Editorial",
    "content": "In the 17th century, when the first large-scale attempts were being made to drain the Fens, an anonymous protest ballad imagined the creaturely resentment coursing through the waters of the wetlands. “For they do mean all Fens to drain, and waters overmaster,” laments a sea lamprey in Powte’s Complaint . “All will be dry, and we must die, ’cause Essex calves want pasture”. The local protests were in vain. Since 1700, according to research published this year, the UK has lost more than 75% of its wetlands as land has been drained for development and farming. The Industrial Revolution inevitably accelerated the destruction of terrain that was viewed simply as wasteland. But the tide may finally be turning for habitats that should be valued as 21st century environmental assets, crucial both to preserving biodiversity and protecting Britain’s coastline. The welcome nomination of England’s east wetlands as a possible Unesco world heritage site, announced by the government this month, potentially places them in the exalted company of the Galápagos Islands. For the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust, the National Trust and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, which jointly put forward the application, the move is a vindication of their efforts to put marshland and mudflats stretching from the Humber to the Thames on the political map. A greater profile will rightly focus attention on ongoing conservation efforts, helping to safeguard the interests of the 155 bird species that rely on the wetlands and their intricate ecosystem. Among other things, these boggy expanses function as a kind of avian pit stop, serving migratory birds travelling the East Atlantic Flyway from the Arctic Circle to southern Africa. This spring, 200,000 birds will feast on their fish and insects, find rich pickings in the mud and use marsh and wet meadow to breed and roost. The bid is therefore good news for guests such as curlews, oystercatchers, knots and pink-footed geese. But the Unesco publicity should also be used kickstart a wider discussion on climate adaptation along Britain’s most vulnerable coastline. Carefully managed and renewed, the wetlands can act in the future as a vital carbon sink and a sponge-like shock absorber for increased water flows. It is projected that the east of England could witness sea level rises of up to 1.15m by 2100. In the country as a whole, an estimated 200,000 coastal properties will be at risk by 2050. Restored wetlands can help reduce the impact of storm surges and flooding, forming a natural line of defence for coastal communities. At Wallasea Island on the Essex coast, for example, 3m tonnes of soil displaced by Crossrail’s construction has been used to recreate a lost wetland landscape, encouraging wildlife and reducing flooding risks. Further projects like that one should be supported. If Unesco status is achieved for the wetlands, two areas that featured in the BBC TV series Wild Isles – the Blakeney nature reserve and RSPB Minsmere – will be included. Neglected and undermined for centuries, some of the most beautiful places in Britain are getting the recognition they deserve. They can also play a vital role in helping the country adapt to the challenges of the future.",

    "author": "Matthew Weaver",
    "content": "Partygate, the scandal that helped bring down Boris Johnson and may yet cost him his parliamentary seat, is being made into docudrama for Channel 4. Partygate the True Story will dramatise numerous drunken parties in Downing during the Covid lockdown, including booze runs to fill a staff wine fridge, vomiting officials, and the breaking of a child’s swing during a garden party. It will also depict how Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson were fined for attending an illegal birthday celebration for the latter. One Johnson supporter claimed the then prime minister was “ambushed by a cake” during a gathering that was also attended by his interior designer, Lulu Lytle, employed at the time to revamp his flat. Announcing its schedule for this year, Channel 4 said: “This meticulously researched docudrama takes viewers inside No 10 as staff partied while the Covid death toll soared and the country diligently observed lockdown restrictions.” The broadcaster said the programme would contrast “the revelry inside the nation’s seat of power with the hardship and sacrifice experienced across the rest of the country”. It is being produced by a team behind Bafta-winning dramas including Killed by My Debt, The Left Behind, and Murdered by My Father. The film-makers will have plenty of material to explore. Partygate was investigated by the former senior civil servant Sue Gray and by the Metropolitan police, and is the subject of an investigation by a cross-party committee of MPs. The Commons privileges committee could punish Johnson if it concludes that he lied to parliament about the parties. A suspension from the Commons of 10 days would trigger a recall petition, which could then lead to a byelection in Johnson’s Uxbridge and South Ruislip seat. The new docudrama will be the second to depict the No 10 operation during the Covid pandemic. Michael Winterbottom’s This England, for Sky, dramatised the first weeks of the lockdown, including Johnson (played by Kenneth Branagh) being treated in hospital for Covid, and Dominic Cummings’ trips to Durham and Barnard Castle.",

    "author": "Aneesa Ahmed",
    "content": "Harry Styles, Little Simz, and Arctic Monkeys’ Alex Turner are among the 72 nominees for this year’s Ivor Novello awards, which honour the best in British and Irish songwriting. At three apiece, the most nominations are given to Harry Styles and his co-writer Kid Harpoon after the huge success of Styles’ third studio album Harry’s House ; and to Cleo Sol and Dean “Inflo” Josiah Cover, for their work with rapper Little Simz and soul collective Sault. In 2021, Styles won his first Ivor Novello for most performed song, eight years after Noel Gallagher praised the awards “because clowns like One Direction aren’t invited”. Styles is nominated for the same award this year, for his track As It Was , alongside Ed Sheeran who makes history for being the first artist to have a song nominated two years in a row, for Bad Habits , which won the category in 2022. Sheeran’s track Shivers is also nominated, alongside Glass Animals’ Heat Waves . Rounding out the category is Kate Bush’s Running Up That Hill, 37 years after it was nominated for best contemporary song. The 1985 hit had a remarkable resurgence after being featured in Netflix show Stranger Things, and reached No 1 in the UK charts – something that Kate Bush called “extraordinary” . Nominated alongside Styles and Kid Harpoon for songwriter of the year are Florence + the Machine, Wet Leg, The 1975, and Central Cee (plus the rapper’s producer Young Chencs). Styles is also nominated for best song musically and lyrically, for As It Was, alongside singer Tom Odell’s Best Day of My Life , Scottish musician Katie Gregson-Macleod’s Complex , Sault’s Stronger and Florence + the Machine’s King . In the running for best contemporary song are Stormzy, Knucks, Raye, Kojey Radical and Wesley Joseph. London rapper Knucks, who released his debut album Alpha Place in May 2022, has two songs listed in the category, one for his track Leon the Professional and another for his feature on Kojey Radical’s Payback. Best album nominations are earned by Little Simz, Fontaines DC, Sault, Obongjayar and Arctic Monkeys, who released their seventh studio album The Car last year. This is the second year in a row that Dean “Inflo” Josiah Cover has dominated the listings for his songwriting and production. Last year he was nominated for four awards for working with Little Simz on her album Sometimes I Might Be Introvert and Adele on 30. 54% of the 72 nominees are receiving their nomination for the first time. They include the nominees for the Rising Star award: Cat Burns, who rose to prominence with her multimillion-streaming single Go, plus pop songwriter Ines Dunn, R&B singer Tendai, drum’n’bass hitmaker Venbee and pop balladeer Victoria Canal. The awards also honour film, TV, and video game scores, with the likes of Avatar: The Way of Water, Don’t Worry Darling and Gotham Knights all being nominated. Tom Gray, chair of the Ivors Academy, heralded “the power and range of British and Irish songwriting and screen composing.” The awards take place on Thursday 18 May at London’s Grosvenor House.",

    "content": "6.48pm BST \n Summary \n \n \n Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the president of Ukraine , visited Ukrainian troops on Tuesday in Avdiivka, Donetsk region, his office have said. Zelenskiy listened to commanders’ reports on the battlefield situation and gave awards to soldiers, it said. \n A Russian judge has rejected an appeal by the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich against the decision to hold him in detention before his trial on charges of espionage . \n Ukraine’s government has criticised Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva for his efforts to broker a peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow, and invited the Brazilian leader to visit the war-torn country and see for himself the consequences of the Russian invasion. \n The Ukrainian First Deputy Prime Minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, has said that the Black Sea grain deal faced the threat of being halted. \n “It is under threat of being halted and Russia has again blocked the inspection of ships,” Svyrydenko told a news conference in Warsaw. \n Poland has said that it has reached an agreement on restarting transit of Ukrainian grains through its territory as of Friday, according to Polish Agriculture Minister Robert Telus. \n The maker of Sweden’s Absolut vodka has said it is ceasing all exports to Russia after calls to boycott the brand flared up in Sweden and on social media, Agence France-Presse reported. \n Security concerns have prompted Russian authorities this year to cancel traditional nationwide victory day processions where people carry portraits of relatives who fought against Nazi Germany in the second world war, Reuters has reported a lawmaker as saying on Tuesday. \n Russia is “not yet” planning to block Wikipedia, its minister of digital affairs said on Tuesday as a Moscow court handed the online encyclopaedia another fine for failing to remove content Russia deems illegal. \n \n \n \n \n 6.28pm BST \n \n Reuters reports that the US Justice Department on Tuesday announced new charges against four Americans in Florida and three Russians for allegedly working on behalf of the Russian government “to conduct a multi-year foreign malign influence campaign in the United States.” \n The superseding indictment from a federal grand jury in Tampa adds charges to Moscow resident Aleksandr Viktorovich Ionov and Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) officers Aleksey Borisovich Sukhodolov and Yegor Sergeyevich Popov, the department said. \n Additionally, a separate unsealed case in Washington charges Russian national Natalia Burlinova “with conspiring with an FSB officer to act as an illegal agent of Russia in the United States.” \n \n \n \n 5.57pm BST \n \n Ukraine’s government has criticised Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva for his efforts to broker a peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow, and invited the Brazilian leader to visit the war-torn country and see for himself the consequences of the Russian invasion. \n The comments came a day after Russia’s minister of foreign affairs, Sergei Lavrov, visited Brasília, and praised Lula’s calls for a negotiated settlement. \n A spokesperson for Ukraine’s foreign ministry said on Tuesday that Kyiv was watching Lula’s efforts to resolve the conflict “with interest” but criticised the Brazilian government for giving equal weight to “the victim and the aggressor”. \n The spokesperson, Oleg Nikolenko, confirmed that Lula had been invited to visit Kyiv “to understand the real causes of Russian aggression and its consequences for global security”. \n Lula has refused to supply weapons to Ukraine and suggested that Brazil could lead a “peace club” of neutral countries to mediate discussions between the two sides, as part of his efforts to return the South American country to international relevance after the isolation of the Jair Bolsonaro years. \n A non-aligned approach is coherent with Brazil’s longstanding foreign policy tradition of peace and cooperation. But the west increasingly views Brazil’s neutrality in the war as skewed towards Russia. \n \n Related: Ukraine criticises Brazil’s peace efforts and invites Lula to see invasion’s effects \n \n \n \n \n 5.34pm BST \n \n The Ukrainian First Deputy Prime Minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, has said that the Black Sea grain deal faced the threat of being halted. \n “It is under threat of being halted and Russia has again blocked the inspection of ships,” Svyrydenko told a news conference in Warsaw. \n “It is extremely important for us to unblock transit, otherwise Ukraine will remain blocked. We cannot together with our partners give Russia the opportunity to take advantage of this situation,” she said. \n This follows the news that Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is expected to discuss the Black Sea grain deal with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres during a visit to New York next week. \n \n \n \n 5.12pm BST \n \n Poland has said that it has reached an agreement on restarting transit of Ukrainian grains through its territory as of Friday, according to Polish Agriculture Minister Robert Telus. \n Reuters reports: \n \n Pressure has been mounting on Brussels to work out a European Union-wide solution after Warsaw and Budapest announced bans on some imports from Ukraine at the weekend, with other countries in eastern Europe saying they are also considering action. \n Farmers say cheap imports from Ukraine, which has faced difficulties exporting by sea due to Russia’s invasion, have lowered prices and reduced their sales. \n In Poland, the issue has created a problem in an election year for the ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party that relies on rural areas for much of its support. \n Ukraine had said its priority was to reopen transit through Poland. \n “We managed to create such mechanisms that will ensure that not a single ton of grain will remain in Poland,” Telus told journalists after two days of talks in Warsaw. \n \n \n \n \n 4.43pm BST \n \n Russia has warned that the outlook for the deal allowing the safe wartime export of grain and fertiliser from Ukrainian Black Sea ports beyond the 18 May is “not so great”. \n Reuters reports: \n \n “Of course, he will be raising that during his bilateral (meeting with Guterres),” Vassily Nebenzia, the Russian U.N. Ambassador told reporters. \n “Nothing is moving, efforts are being made but unfortunately they are fruitless for us,” he said, referring to U.N. attempts to help facilitate Russia’s own food and fertiliser exports despite broad Western sanctions imposed on Moscow over the invasion. \n “So far, no optimistic news ... We clearly said we want to see progress,” Nebenzia said. \n The grain export deal was brokered by the United Nations and Turkey in July last year to help tackle a global food crisis that U.N. officials said had been worsened by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the most deadly war in Europe since World War Two. \n It was extended in November and then last month Russia only agreed to renew the deal for at least 60 days, half the intended period. Moscow said it would only consider a further extension if several demands in relation to its own exports were met. \n To help persuade Russia to allow Ukraine to resume Black Sea grain exports, a separate three-year pact was also struck in July in which the U.N. agreed to help Russia export food and fertiliser. \n \n \n \n \n 4.01pm BST \n \n According to the TASS news agency, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is expected to discuss the Black Sea grain deal with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres during a visit to New York next week. \n The Black Sea grain export deal was renewed for 60 days last month, but Russia has signalled it may not agree to extend it further unless the West removes what it says are obstacles to the export of Russian grain and fertiliser. \n \n \n \n 3.30pm BST \n \n Agence France-Presse in Stockholm reports that t he maker of Sweden’s Absolut vodka has said it is ceasing all exports to Russia after calls to boycott the brand flared up in Sweden and on social media. \n The Absolut Company said it had “decided to stop the export of its brand to Russia”. \n Stephanie Durroux, the firm’s chief executive, said in a statement that the company was exercising its “duty of care” towards its employees and partners. “We cannot expose them to massive criticism in all forms,” she added. \n Absolut’s owner, Pernod Ricard, confirmed earlier in April that it had resumed some exports to Russia after previously halting them in March 2022, soon after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine . \n The company noted that since November last year, Russia had changed importation regulations allowing for parallel imports of alcohol without the permission of authorised importers, thus bypassing the EU sanctions. \n Pernod Ricard stressed that the decision to resume exports was made in part to protect its staff in Russia from “criminal liability” and accusations of “intentional bankruptcy”. \n \n Related: Absolut vodka exports to Russia discontinued after outcry in Sweden \n \n \n \n \n 3.21pm BST \n \n Here are some images Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s visit to the Donetsk region. \n \n Updated at 3.34pm BST \n \n \n 2.54pm BST \n \n Volodymyr Zelenskiy has visited Ukrainian troops in Avdiivka in eastern Ukraine, according to officials from the country who released video footage of the trip. The president heard reports from military commanders on the situation on the battlefield and handed out awards to soldiers. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Updated at 2.58pm BST \n \n \n 2.40pm BST \n \n Security concerns have prompted Russian authorities this year to cancel traditional nationwide victory day processions where people carry portraits of relatives who fought against Nazi Germany in the second world war, Reuters has reported a lawmaker as saying on Tuesday. \n Since 2012, the “immortal regiment” processions have become an important feature of national celebrations on 9 May, a public holiday when Russia honours the 27 million Soviet citizens who died in the struggle to defeat Adolf Hitler’s invasion. \n But Tass news agency quoted the lawmaker Yelena Tsunayeva as saying the marches would not take place this year since a number of regions, including Russian-annexed Crimea, had pulled out “because of the threat”. \n Tsunayeva did not specify a threat, although Russia has claimed that Ukraine has been behind bomb attacks on Russian soil. \n Tass quotes Tsunayeva as saying: “This is still a single indivisible story, the immortal regiment procession, if somewhere people do not have such an opportunity, let’s use other options.” \n She said everyone was invited to post photos of their veteran relatives on social networks, on clothes, on a car and on the website of the movement. \n Vladimir Putin took part in last year’s march in Moscow, carrying a picture of his father. \n \n Updated at 2.57pm BST \n \n \n 2.29pm BST \n \n Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass reports that the ambassadors of the US, UK and Canada have been summoned to the foreign ministry over their comments about the sentencing yesterday of the opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza . \n Tass quotes the ministry saying: \n \n In connection with gross interference in the internal affairs of Russia and activities that do not correspond to diplomatic status, the ambassadors of the US, Britain and Canada have been summoned to the foreign ministry. \n \n The report also cites Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova , saying she “stressed that Moscow considers unacceptable the statements of British ambassador Deborah Bronnert after the sentence of Kara-Murza and warned London against the politicisation of international human rights issues. Zakharova also called ‘the height of cynicism’ the demands of the US and Canadian ambassadors to release Kara-Murza, while in their homeland human rights are shamelessly violated and dissidents are persecuted.” \n \n Updated at 2.53pm BST \n \n \n 2.13pm BST \n \n Russia is “not yet” planning to block Wikipedia, its minister of digital affairs said on Tuesday as a Moscow court handed the online encyclopaedia another fine for failing to remove content Russia deems illegal. \n “We are not blocking Wikipedia yet, there are no such plans for now,” Interfax news agency quoted the digital affairs minister, Maksut Shadaev , as saying at a data forum in Moscow. \n Reuters reports that on Tuesday, Moscow’s Tagansky district dourt fined Wikipedia owner Wikimedia Foundation 800,000 roubles (£7,900/$9,800) for what Russian news agencies said was a failure to remove information considered to be promoting train hopping, where a person rides on the side or top of a train. \n The Wikimiedia Foundation has previously been fined for failing to remove what Russian courts have deemed false information about the war in Ukraine. \n \n Updated at 2.54pm BST \n \n \n 2.11pm BST \n \n Russia’s leading opposition figure, Alexei Navalny, faces the prospect of new criminal charges, one of his lawyers has claimed. \n Reuters reports that Vadim Kobzev alleged on Twitter that authorities had provoked Navalny by placing another inmate in his cell, and that Navalny had been given no choice but to drag him out. \n He had then been told he would be charged with thwarting prison authorities, which carries a maximum sentence of five years, Kobzev said. \n The penitentiary service, which has in the past denied allegations of mistreatment, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. \n \n \n \n 2.07pm BST \n \n Poland this month presented a proposal for a new set of sanctions against Russia for waging war against Ukraine, according to a document seen by Reuters on Tuesday, including a ban on pipeline oil and diamond imports. \n The written proposal, which a diplomatic source said was delivered to the EU executive European Commission, marks the opening of what is bound to be long and complex negotiations among the bloc’s 27 countries. \n All EU members must agree to impose new sanctions. The bloc has already put in place 10 rounds of punitive steps against Russia since Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. \n Warsaw’s proposal would stop Russian oil imports via the northern leg of the Druzhba pipeline going to Germany. It would end imports of Russian diamonds and natural gas, including LNG, and curb nuclear energy cooperation. Germany and Lithuania are also for nuclear energy sanctions with leniency for those like Hungary and France who trade with Russia. \n Hungary, which last week said it had agreed to modify its contract with Russia’s Rosatom for the expansion of the Paks nuclear plant, has so far firmly opposed any sanctions on Russian nuclear energy. \n Belgium, home to the world’s biggest diamond trading hub Antwerp, has successfully lobbied against barring Russian imports so far. \n \n Updated at 2.17pm BST \n \n \n 1.40pm BST \n \n A Russian judge has rejected an appeal by the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich against the decision to hold him in detention before his trial on charges of espionage . \n Gershkovich, 31, is the first US journalist to be detained in Russia on espionage charges since the end of the cold war and, if found guilty, could face up to 20 years in prison. \n Russia’s FSB security service has accused him of collecting state secrets about Russia’s military for the benefit of US intelligence, charges that have been roundly condemned as political and unfounded. \n Hearings in his case are being held in closed sessions because of the nature of the charges, but cameras were briefly allowed into the courtroom before Tuesday’s hearing started. The court was only deciding whether to hold Gershkovich in pre-trial detention, not on the substance of the case. \n It was the first time the outside world has seen proper footage of Gershkovich since his arrest at the end of March. The reporter was standing inside a glass case known informally as an “aquarium”, where defendants in Russian court cases are often held. He appeared calm and was pictured smiling. Marks on one of his wrists appeared to show where he had been kept in handcuffs. \n \n Related: Russian judge rejects WSJ reporter Evan Gershkovich’s detention appeal \n \n \n Updated at 1.52pm BST \n \n \n 1.26pm BST \n Zelenskiy visists troops in Avdiivka \n \n Volodymyr Zelenskiy , the president of Ukraine, visited Ukrainian troops on Tuesday in Avdiivka, Donetsk region, his office have said. \n Zelenskiy listened to commanders’ reports on the battlefield situation and gave awards to soldiers, it said. \n “I have the honour to be here today, to thank you for your service, for defending our land, Ukraine, our families,” Zelenskiy was quoted as saying. \n \n Updated at 1.32pm BST \n \n \n 12.53pm BST \n \n Ukraine has denied that Russian inspectors have restarted ship inspections under the Black Sea grain deal. \n Speaking to Reuters , a senior Ukrainian official who asked not to be identified said: “Nothing has been resolved. There are no inspections.” \n Russia’s RIA news agency reported earlier on Tuesday that inspections of ships moving grain from Ukraine had restarted, citing a senior Russian foreign ministry official. \n \n Updated at 1.10pm BST \n \n \n 12.24pm BST \n \n The US journalist Evan Gershkovich, who denies a Russian accusation that he is a spy, appeared in a Moscow courtroom today at a hearing to appeal against a decision to keep him in pre-trial detention in a former KGB prison until at least 29 May. \n Reuters reports: \n \n Gershkovich, a reporter for the Wall Street Journal, looked calm and smiled as he stood in a glass and metal cage, wearing a checked shirt with his arms folded in front of him. \n He did not say anything, but turned around when one of the Russian reporters in the courtroom told him to “Hold fast!” and relayed to him that everyone said “Hi”. U.S. Ambassador Lynne Tracy stood nearby. \n Russia’s FSB security service arrested Gershkovich on March 29 in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg on espionage charges that carry a possible 20-year prison sentence for collecting what it said were state secrets about the military industrial complex, a charge he denies. \n The Kremlin has said Gershkovich, the first U.S. journalist detained in Russia on espionage charges since the end of the Cold War, was caught “red-handed.” \n The United States has deemed him “wrongfully detained,” his employer and colleagues have said he is innocent, and President Joe Biden has called his detention illegal. \n Tuesday’s hearing is essentially procedural, covering how Gershkovich should be detained as he awaits trial, not about the substance of the charges against him as investigators are still working on the details of the case. \n Court documents gave nothing more than basic details about the case. The court said it was forbidden to publish some documents. A Russian lawyer for Gershkovich did not respond to a request for comment. \n Gershkovich, the American son of Soviet emigres, is being held at the Lefortovo prison, which in Soviet times was run by the KGB but is now operated by the Federal Penitentiary Service. \n Traditionally it has been used to hold those suspected by the FSB of spying and other grave crimes. \n Tracy, the US ambassador, said on Monday she had made her first visit to Gershkovich. \n “He feels well and is holding up. We reiterate our call for Evan’s immediate release,” Tracy said in a statement. \n In Washington, the White House said it hopes to get regular consular access to Gershkovich. \n “It was good to get to see him today and again we want to make sure we can continue to do that,” White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said. \n The United States last week designated Gershkovich as “wrongfully detained”, in effect saying that the spy charges were bogus and the case was political. \n The US hostage envoy has pledged to do “whatever it takes” to bring home Gershkovich and Paul Whelan, an American ex-Marine who was convicted of espionage in 2020 and has also been designated by Washington as wrongfully detained. \n A spokesperson for The Wall Street Journal did not respond on Monday to a request for comment. \n \n \n Updated at 12.50pm BST \n \n \n 12.05pm BST \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Vladimir Putin has visited military headquarters in Russian-controlled Ukraine’s Kherson and Luhansk regions, the Kremlin has said. The president attended a military command meeting in the Kherson region to hear reports of the airborne forces and the ‘Dnieper’ army group and other senior officers on the situation in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, both of which Moscow has proclaimed part of Russia. \n Russian troops retreated from Kherson, the regional capital, in November, and have been reinforcing their positions on the opposite bank of the Dnipro River in anticipation of a Ukrainian counter-offensive. The Kremlin did not say when Putin attended the meetings. \n \n \n \n 11.48am BST \n \n Switzerland has condemned Russia’s war against Ukraine in the strongest terms, it is very much committed to humanitarian aid for Ukraine and is doing everything possible to seriously implement sanctions against Russia, its president has said today. \n At a joint news conference with Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, Alain Berset said: “We adopted the (EU) sanctions and of course we take this completely seriously and we are simply doing everything that can be done in order to enforce them seriously.” \n \n Updated at 12.06pm BST \n \n \n 11.27am BST \n \n Romania’s ruling Social Democrat party (PSD) has said it will ask the coalition government to approve an emergency decree enforcing a temporary ban on Ukrainian grain imports, mirroring similar moves by countries in central and eastern Europe. \n Reuters reports: \n \n On Monday, Slovakia joined Poland and Hungary in banning grain imports from Ukraine as even Kyiv’s staunchest allies come under domestic pressure to shield their agriculture markets. \n “PSD will ask the governing coalition to make a political decision to enable ... the government to issue the decree,” the party, to which the agriculture minister belongs, said in a statement. \n “At the same time, Romania must continue to support Ukraine by facilitating the transit of farm products to other European Union states or to Black Sea commercial routes.” \n \n \n Updated at 12.06pm BST \n \n \n 11.05am BST \n Summary of the day so far … \n \n \n Vladimir Putin has visited military headquarters in Russian-occupied areas Ukraine , the Kremlin has said. Putin was shown on Russian state television disembarking a military helicopter in Russian-held Ukraine and greeting senior military commanders. It was not stated when the visit took place. \n The Kremlin said Putin attended a military command meeting in the Kherson region. He heard reports from commanders of the airborne forces and the “Dnieper” army group and other senior officers on the situation in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, both of which Moscow has proclaimed part of Russia. The Russian president also visited national guard headquarters in Ukraine’s Luhansk region in the eastern Donbas, which Moscow also claims to have annexed along with adjacent Donetsk region. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich has appeared in court to appeal on Tuesday against his detention in Moscow on charges of espionage. The court will hear a complaint filed by Gershkovich against the decision to keep him in custody in Lefortovo prison while the case is being investigated. The hearing is essentially procedural covering how Gershkovich should be detained as he awaits trial, not about the substance of the charges. \n \n \n Poland and Ukraine will resume negotiations early on Tuesday to try to reopen the transit of food and grains, the Polish agriculture minister told public radio station PR1. The two countries held talks on Monday over bans by central eastern European countries seeking to shelter their farmers from the impact of an influx of cheaper Ukrainian grain. \n Russian forces are stepping up their use of heavy artillery and air strikes in the devastated eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut , the commander of Ukraine’s ground forces said on Tuesday. \n Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu , told his Chinese counterpart on Tuesday that their countries’ military cooperation was a “stabilising” force in the world and helped to reduce the chances of conflict. \n The Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko , held a meeting with the Russian-installed head of Ukraine’s occupied Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin , on Tuesday. \n \n \n \n \n 11.01am BST \n \n The FT’s Max Seddon has published video from inside the court, noting that “media are allowed to take photos and videos of Evan [ Gershkovich ] in the cage, but not speak to him.

The Chinese defence minister, Li Shangfu , is in Moscow as the countries look to deepen their military cooperation. \n Reuters cites Interfax quoting Shoigu saying: “The coordination of our efforts in the international arena has a stabilising effect on the global situation and helps to reduce the potential for conflict.” \n \n Updated at 10.32am BST \n \n \n 10.03am BST \n \n Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass is carrying further details of the meeting between the Belarusian leader Alexander, Lukashenko , and the Russian-imposed leader of the occupied Donetsk People’s Republic, Denis Pushilin , in Minsk. \n Tass quotes Lukashenko saying: \n \n I would like, as they say, first-hand, to hear the situation in the Donetsk People’s Republic, if possible. How are we doing there at the front? There are very intense battles going on. Both to the north and to the south. Yes, and in the direction of Donetsk. Shelling, it’s hard for people. And in this situation, what can Belarus do for Donetsk, how can we help? There is a lot of work ahead. We need to recover, we need to revive industrial enterprises, agriculture. In the end, people will live there. This is 100%. And people need to be fed. \n \n \n Updated at 10.13am BST \n \n \n 9.57am BST \n Ukraine says Russian claim Black Sea grain shipments have resumed is untrue \n \n Luke Harding reports for the Guardian from Ukraine: \n Ukraine says Russia’s claim that grain shipments in the Black Sea had resumed was “a lie” and said Moscow was continuing to block inspections. \n Officials said a statement by Russia’s RIA news agency that the UN-brokered initiative was working were categorically untrue. \n They said Russia, for the second time, stopped inspections yesterday of Ukrainian ships waiting to return to port. Inspections had not yet resumed today. \n Under the deal signed by Ukraine, Russia and Turkey, Ukraine submits names of bulk carriers each day to be inspected. Last week, and again on Monday, Russia scrubbed up the names, meaning no inspections were carried out and the grain corridor didn’t function. \n “It’s unacceptable,” one official told the Guardian on Tuesday \n \n \n \n 9.33am BST \n \n Here is some of the video released by the Kremlin of Vladimir Putin ’s visit to occupied Ukraine. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9.16am BST \n \n A quick snap from Reuters, citing the state-run Belta news agency, reports that the Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko , held a meeting with the Russian-installed head of Ukraine’s occupied Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin , on Tuesday. \n \n Updated at 9.28am BST \n \n \n 9.14am BST \n \n Russia’s ministry of defence has posted to its official Telegram about Vladimir Putin ’s visit to occupied Ukraine. It said: \n \n The situation in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia directions was discussed during a meeting at the Dniepr group of forces headquarters. The president received reports from Col Gen Mikhail Teplinsky, the commander of the airborne troops, Col Gen Oleg Makarevich, the commander of the Dniepr group of forces, and other military commanders. \n At the Vostok National Guard headquarters in Luhansk People’s Republic, Putin received reports from Col Gen Aleksandr Lapin and other high-ranking officers on the situation there. \n \n \n \n \n 8.56am BST \n Evan Gershkovich will appeal against arrest in Russian court today \n \n Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich will appeal on Tuesday against his arrest and detention in Moscow on charges of espionage, according to court documents, Reuters reports. \n According to a public Russian judicial document, a Russian court will hear on Tuesday a complaint filed by Gershkovich against the decision to keep him in custody in Lefortovo prison while the case is being investigated. \n The court documents gave nothing more than basic details about the case. The court said it was forbidden to publish some documents. A Russian lawyer for Gershkovich did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters. \n The hearing is essentially procedural covering how Gershkovich should be detained as he awaits trial, not about the substance of the charges as investigators are still working on the details of the case. \n \n \n \n 8.16am BST \n Russia increases shelling, air strikes in Bakhmut – Ukrainian general \n \n Russian forces are stepping up their use of heavy artillery and air strikes in the devastated eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, the commander of Ukraine’s ground forces said on Tuesday. \n Fighting in and around Bakhmut has for months been the focus of the war in Ukraine. \n “Currently, the enemy is increasing the activity of heavy artillery and the number of airstrikes, turning the city into ruins,” Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi said in a statement, Reuters reports. \n He said Russia remained committed to taking Bakhmut “at any cost” but was suffering significant losses in the battle for the city. \n It has been difficult to independently verify the battlefield situation on the ground. The head of the Wagner mercenary group, which has spearheaded Russia’s attempt to take Bakhmut, said this month that its fighters controlled more than 80% of the city. Ukraine denied this, saying it still controlled considerably more than 20% of the city. \n \n \n \n 8.13am BST \n \n Here are some of the images of V ladimir Putin visiting occupied Ukraine, which have come from a video released by the Kremlin this morning. They appear to show the Russian president in occupied Kherson and occupied Luhansk , two of the regions of Ukraine which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed. \n \n Updated at 9.30am BST \n \n \n 7.40am BST \n \n Volodymyr Zelenskiy has posted on his official Telegram channel to state that since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, over 2,000 Ukrainian service personnel have been returned from captivity. Ukraine’s president posted: \n \n Since 24 February, Ukraine has returned 2,235 Ukrainian men and women from Russian captivity. We remember everyone. We will bring back each and every one. \n \n \n \n \n 7.37am BST \n \n Here is a little more on what appears to have been a visit to occupied areas of Ukraine by Russian President Vladimir Putin , his second in two months. \n Associated Press reports that the Kremlin video, broadcast by Russian state television showed Putin visiting the command post for Russian forces in the occupied southern Kherson region. It showed Putin arriving by helicopter to receive reports from the top military brass about the combat situation. \n The Russian leader then moved by helicopter to the headquarters of the Russian National Guard of the occupied eastern Luhansk region to hear report from commanders. \n In both locations, Putin congratulated the military on the Orthodox Easter that was celebrated Sunday, and presented them with icons. \n The exact location and time the released footage of Putin in Ukraine was taken has not been independently verified. \n Last month, Putin visited the Russian-held Sea of Azov port city of Mariupol , which was captured by Russian troops in May after two months of fierce fighting. It was interpreted as a show of defiance, coming days after the international criminal court issued an arrest warrant for him on war crimes charges. \n \n \n \n 7.31am BST \n \n Patrick Wintour, the Guardian diplomatic editor, reports on the thorny issue of corruption in Ukraine : \n A fierce debate has broken out in Ukraine over allegations that a clampdown on corruption is being used to frame high profile business advocates of state reform, raising wider doubts about Ukraine’s internal political trajectory – and its ability to absorb billions in European reconstruction funds once the war ends. \n The concerns have been expressed to the US Department of State and UK Foreign Office, and are shared in part by Ukrainian anti-corruption campaigners. \n The issue is diplomatically sensitive since critics are wary of playing into a Russian narrative that Ukraine is endemically corrupt, or suggesting that anti-corruption institutions, which western allies and Ukrainian civil society played a large part in establishing, have gone off the rails. \n Katya Ryzhenko, from Transparency International Ukraine, called for a review of the anti-corruption authority of Ukraine (known by its Ukrainian acronym Nabu). \n “It is a good sign that despite being in the middle of a war, Ukraine’s anti-corruption ecosystem is not afraid to go after the big names and to have these cases transparently adjudicated by independent judges.” But, she added “the cases have highlighted serious problems in how Ukraine’s anti-corruption bodies operate”. \n A former Ukrainian official who was instrumental in campaigning for the establishment of Ukraine’s anti-corruption bodies said that officials appeared to be targeting people for corporate governance breaches, rather than overt corruption . “This is a tragedy in which there will be no winners,” the former official said. \n Read more of Patrick Wintour’s report here: High stakes for Ukraine as clampdown on corruption comes under scrutiny \n \n Related: High stakes for Ukraine as clampdown on corruption comes under scrutiny \n \n \n \n \n 7.28am BST \n \n You may have seen that we are testing a new feature across some of the Guardian’s live blogs, including the Ukraine live blog , which allows you to contact some of our live bloggers directly.

We want these products to go to Europe, but go deep into Europe,” Reuters reports agriculture minister Robert Telus said. \n “We talked yesterday, there were long talks. Today we are also sitting down for talks. These are typically technical talks to find a solution and let this transit go to Europe,” he added. \n Some farmers in countries bordering Ukraine have complained that the additional availability of grain that the Ukrainians have not been able to export via sea routes has flooded the European market and depressed prices. \n \n \n \n 7.16am BST \n \n Reuters reports, citing Tass, that Russia’s defence ministry said on Tuesday two Russian strategic bombers – those capable of carrying nuclear warheads – carried out what it described as routine patrol flights over the Sea of Okhotsk and the Bering Sea , off Russia’s eastern coast, as part of the military exercises currently being carried out in Russia’s Pacific zone. \n On Monday, Japan lodged a protest with Russia over its military activity near disputed islands in the region. \n \n Updated at 9.42am BST \n \n \n 7.00am BST \n \n The exact sequencing of any major drawdown of forces in Bakhmut has become a “critical question” for both sides, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update. \n Ukraine wants “to free-up an offensive force while Russia likely aspires to regenerate an operational reserve,” the update said, adding that Russian forces continue to make “creeping advances” in the devastated eastern city. \n It also noted that heavy fighting was continuing along the Donbas front line. \n “However, there is a realistic possibility that Russia has reduced troop numbers and is decreasing offensive action around Donetsk city, most likely to divert resources towards the Bakhmut sector.” \n \n \n Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 18 April 2023.

Leaked US government documents have revealed that China has approved the provision of weapons to Moscow but wants shipments to remain a secret. \n \n \n \n 6.14am BST \n \n Inspections of ships moving grains from Ukraine have restarted after a pause which threatened to shut down the Black Sea shipping corridor, the RIA news agency cited the Russian foreign ministry as saying on Tuesday. \n A ministry official quoted by RIA blamed Monday’s interruption on Ukraine’s failure to observe agreed procedures but said the issue has been resolved, Reuters reported. \n Kyiv said on Monday the UN-brokered initiative allowing the safe Black Sea export of Ukrainian grain was in danger of shutting down after Russia blocked inspections of participating ships in Turkish waters. \n Pyotr Ilyichyov, head of the international organisations department at Russia’s foreign ministry, told RIA that the passage of grain ships depended both on the weather and on how well they observed the procedures. \n It remains unclear if the grain deal, in place since last July, will be renewed, as Russia complains another agreement, aimed at facilitating its own agricultural and fertilizer exports, has not been upheld. \n Speaking at a G7 meeting in Japan, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken accused Russia of breaking its promises to countries around the world that are dependent on grain that has not been able to get out of Ukraine over the last few days. \n \n \n \n 5.59am BST \n Putin attends military meeting in Kherson \n \n Russian president Vladimir Putin has attended a military command meeting in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region which is partly held by Russia, the Kremlin has said. \n Putin heard reports from commanders of the airborne forces and the “Dnieper” army group as well as other senior officers who briefed him on the situation in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, both of which Moscow has proclaimed part of Russia, Reuters reported. \n Russian troops retreated from Kherson, the regional capital, last November, and have been reinforcing their positions on the opposite bank of the Dnipro river in anticipation of the Ukrainian counteroffensive. \n The Kremlin did not say when Putin attended the military command meeting. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Updated at 1.25pm BST \n \n \n 5.52am BST \n \n The White House has hit back after Brazil’s president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said on a trip to China that the US should stop “encouraging” the war in Ukraine \n “In this case, Brazil is parroting Russian and Chinese propaganda without at all looking at the facts,” the US’s national security council spokesperson John Kirby said, adding that Lula’s comments were “deeply problematic”. \n The spat came as Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov began a tour of Latin America in Brazil where he met Lula and thanked “our Brazilian friends for their clear understanding of the genesis of the situation [in Ukraine]”. \n Lula also said the US and Europe “need to start talking about peace,” and that Kyiv shares the blame for the conflict, which began in February 2022 when Russian forces invaded Ukraine. \n His remarks echoed a line frequently used by Moscow and Beijing, which blame the West for the war. \n Brazilian foreign minister Mauro Vieira, who also met with his Russian counterpart earlier in the day, shot back, saying: “I don’t know how or why he reached that conclusion but I do not agree at all.” \n AFP reports on the background to the spat: \n \n Despite Lula‘s comments about the United States, the 77-year-old, who returned to power in January after serving two terms from 2003 to 2010, is also seeking closer ties with Washington. \n His visit to China and the UAE, postponed by a bout of pneumonia, came after a White House meeting in February with US president Joe Biden. \n Brazil has not joined Western nations in imposing sanctions on Russia for its invasion, and has refused requests to supply ammunition to Ukraine. \n After meeting with his Brazilian counterpart on Monday, Lavrov said: “We are grateful to our Brazilian friends for their clear understanding of the genesis of the situation (in Ukraine). We are grateful for their desire to contribute to finding ways of settling this situation.” \n “We are interested in resolving the conflict as soon as possible,” Lavrov said. \n But he added that any solution would have to be based on “multipolarity,” accusing the West of “trying to dominate the international arena.” \n Washington doesn’t have “any objection to any country that wants to try to bring an end to the war,” Kirby said. \n “That could happen right now, today, if Mr (Russian President Vladimir) Putin would stop attacking Ukraine and pull its troops out.” \n Lavrov’s trip to Brazil comes after Lula’s top foreign policy adviser, Celso Amorim, met with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin in March to discuss opening peace talks. \n Brazil is Lavrov’s first stop on a weeklong Latin American tour that will also include Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba - countries whose leftist governments have hostile relations with the United States. \n Lavrov and Vieira said their talks had also focused on energy and trade. \n About a quarter of agricultural powerhouse Brazil’s fertilizer imports come from Russia, while the two countries engaged in a record $9.8 billion in bilateral trade last year. \n \n \n \n \n 5.39am BST \n Opening summary \n \n Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine with me, Helen Livingstone. Our top story today: \n The US has accused Brazil of parroting Russian and Chinese propaganda on the war in Ukraine after president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said on a trip to China that the US “needs to stop encouraging war and start talking about peace”. \n “In this case, Brazil is parroting Russian and Chinese propaganda without at all looking at the facts,” the US’s national security council spokesperson John Kirby said, adding that Lula’s comments were “deeply problematic”. \n The spat came as Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov began a tour of Latin America in Brazil where he met Lula and thanked “our Brazilian friends for their clear understanding of the genesis of the situation [in Ukraine]”. \n Other key developments: \n \n Inspections of ships moving grains from Ukraine have restarted after a pause which threatened to shut down the Black Sea corridor , the RIA news agency, citing the Russian foreign ministry, said. A ministry official quoted by RIA blamed Monday’s interruption on Ukraine’s failure to observe agreed procedures but said the issue has been resolved. \n The UK has condemned the sentencing of Russian opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza , who was jailed for 25 years for opposing the war in Ukraine. UK foreign secretary James Cleverly summoned the Russian ambassador, Andrei Kelin, for an explanation. Kara-Murza holds dual Russian-British citizenship. \n Kara-Murza’s wife, Evgenia Kara-Murza, told British broadcaster LBC that she was “baffled” by the UK government’s “weak” response . “Introducing sanctions against his perpetrators would actually be a very practical step that I would very much like to see,” she said. \n The UN’s human rights head, Volker Türk, urged Russia to release him, while Baltic neighbour Latvia sanctioned 10 Russian officials and lawyers involved in the case. \n US ambassador to Russia Lynne Tracy said she had made her first visit to jailed Wall Street reporter Evan Gershkovich , who was arrested in Russia two weeks ago on charges of spying. “He feels well and is holding up. We reiterate our call for Evan’s immediate release,” Tracy said. \n The United States and more than 40 other countries said in a joint statement that they were deeply concerned over Russia’s detainment of a Wall Street Journal reporter and protested Moscow’s “efforts to limit and intimidate the media.” The statement read further: “We urge Russian Federation authorities to release those they hold on political grounds, and to end the draconian crackdown on freedom of expression, including against members of the media.” \n Two Russian fighter jets and a spy plane flying close to Nato airspace have been intercepted by the UK and German air forces . Eurofighter typhoons from the RAF and the German air force’s 71 Richtofen Wing were scrambled to intercept the jets as they flew over the Baltic Sea and Gulf of Finland. \n The Pentagon said it expected findings within 45 days from a review into how the US military handles classified information after last week’s arrest of an airman over the leak a trove of highly classified documents online. \n Russia said it had repelled an “illegal” Ukrainian attempt to infiltrate Russian territory in the southern border region of Bryansk , 11 days after reporting a similar incident. “The intruder stepped on a mined protection line,” said regional governor Alexander Bogomaz on Telegram. \n Slovakia will temporarily halt imports of grains and other selected products from Ukraine to protect its farmers , joining Poland and Hungary in the move, a government spokesperson said on Monday. Ukraine and Poland meanwhile began talks aimed at reaching an agreement on imports. \n Slovakia has handed over all 13 MiG-29 fighter jets it had pledged to Ukraine , the Slovak defence ministry. \n Almost 500 children have been killed in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion, according to a report by the Ukrainian prosecutor general . As of Monday, 470 children had been killed and 948 injured, it said, adding that the department believes that the number of injured children is higher.",

    "title": "Rishi Sunak’s wife’s stake in childcare firm not mentioned in six ministerial registers",
    "author": "Peter Walker Political correspondent",
    "content": "Opposition parties have called on Downing Street to provide answers over Rishi Sunak’s family financial interests as the Guardian discovered that previous ministerial registers made no mention of his wife’s stake in a childcare firm, even though it began in 2019. The prime minister could be ordered to apologise to the House of Commons if an inquiry announced on Monday into his declarations about the investment finds he breached the code of conduct for MPs. Companies House records show Akshata Murty first took a stake in Koru Kids, one of six childcare companies that stand to benefit from a policy announcement in last month’s budget, in March 2019, when she held 20,000 shares in the firm. While the register of ministerial interests has not been updated for nearly a year following the resignation of Boris Johnson’s adviser on interests, the six registers published since March 2019, when Murty took the stake, have no mention of it. The first of these does not refer to Murty at all, while the five subsequent versions, the last of which was published in May 2022, says only that Sunak’s wife “owns a venture capitalist investment company, Catamaran Ventures UK Ltd”. The records for Koru Kids show Murty owns the shares in her name, not that of the investment company. The most recent records show she still has 20,000 shares. Downing Street has said it cannot comment while the inquiry is under way, beyond reiterating that the shareholding had been “transparently declared as a ministerial interest”. Unlike the parallel register of MPs’ interests, not every interest declared by ministers to the relevant civil service head of their department is publicly listed, as it is up to the adviser on ministers’ interests, who is now Laurie Magnus, to decide whether this is necessary. It is therefore possible that Sunak declared the shareholding in Koru Kids but that Mangus’s predecessors, Christopher Geidt and Alex Allan, who between them held the role until June last year, thought it did not need to be published. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said: “Rishi Sunak should have declared his financial interests as a minister, chancellor and prime minister, as is required by his own ministerial code. But with no list of interests for nearly a year, his failure to come clean on what he declared gives the impression he’s got something to hide. “He could clear it up by simply saying when and how he has declared these potential conflicts of interest and whether steps have been taken to manage them in line with the code.” Daisy Cooper, the Liberal Democrat deputy leader, called for the rules to be changed and for Sunak to provide clarity. “Rishi Sunak needs to come before parliament and explain why this wasn’t featured in the previous registers of ministerial interests,” she said. “It is absurd that the rules mean that government ministers can currently get away with publicly declaring less than a backbench MP. “We need a total overhaul of the system, to ensure that the ministerial register of interests is regularly published and has more rigorous standards. The public has a right to know.” One difficulty for Sunak is that as part of his inquiry, the standards commissioner, Daniel Greenberg, is expected to look into whether the prime minister should have declared the interest when questioned by a committee of MPs last month, where the rules are stricter than for registering interests. Appearing before the liaison committee on 28 March, Sunak was asked by the Labour MP Catherine McKinnell about a proposed pilot scheme to incentivise people to become childminders, with Koru Kids among six private childcare providers involved. When McKinnell asked Sunak whether he had anything to declare in relation to the scheme, he replied: “No, all my disclosures are declared in the normal way.” The MPs’ code of conduct states that not only must members be “open and frank” in declaring interests, but mentioning a declaration without explaining what it is “will not suffice on its own”. If Greenberg finds Sunak should have been more open with the liaison committee, there is the option of “rectification”, where he admits fault and amends the record. However, if the prime minister refuses this, or if Greenberg decides he has not been properly transparent, Sunak’s case could be referred to the standards committee, made up of MPs and lay members, for punishment. A suspension from the Commons seems very unlikely – of 66 MPs suspended since 1949, only one had this happen because of a non-declaration of interests, the Conservative MP John Browne in 1990. But it is possible Sunak could be ordered to apologise.",

    "title": "Ofgem’s voluntary code on prepayment meters seems a bit of a mess | Nils Pratley",
    "author": "Nils Pratley",
    "content": "A voluntary code on involuntary installations sounds like a muddle. That impression is reinforced when reading the detail of Ofgem’s attempt to put a stop to some energy suppliers’ thuggish approach to fitting prepayment meters. You have to be aged 85 or over and living alone, or be extremely incapacitated or severely or terminally ill, to be in the “high risk” category that Ofgem says should never have a meter installed forcibly. Why set the age cut-off as high as 85? There was no explanation. Meanwhile, the “medium risk” category, for which the new code of practice prescribes “further assessment required by suppliers on a case-by-case basis” – not an outright ban, in other words – includes medical conditions that would strike most people as severe, or probably potentially so. Try Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, learning difficulties and respiratory conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. How will assessments of such “medium risk” indebted customers be made in practice? Will British Gas et al be expected to recruit medical specialists to judge whether an 84-year-old with Alzheimer’s, say, could be harmed if he or she is unable to top up the unwanted new meter for whatever reason? Strange as it sounds, the regulator seems to imagine something along those lines. The code says welfare officers must be present or contactable in what Ofgem calls “edge” cases. It would surely be simpler and fairer to impose a simple ban on forced installations, and remote switching of smart meters, for disabled people, as urged by the disability equality charity Scope. The suppliers, or some of them (Ofgem is still investigating), are the primary villains, we shouldn’t forget, but the current mess is partly of the regulator’s making because it was blind to abuses until a Times investigation served up the evidence in February. An alert regulator would have heeded the warnings last summer from Citizens Advice and others that tougher safeguards were needed when the number of forced installations started to surge. Even under the long-established rules, the forced installation of a meter was meant only to be a “last resort” mechanism. That said, in three respects, one can sympathise with the regulator’s predicament in trying to cleanse the stables. First, the code of practice is only voluntary because Ofgem must run a statutory consultation before it can change suppliers’ operating licences. The legal hurdles should still be cleared in time for next winter. Second, the law allows suppliers to try to recover debts, which means a regulator must allow for those rare cases where a customer is capable of paying but refuses. As the law stands, a blanket ban on involuntary switches was always going to be a non-starter. Third, last year’s spike in forced installations (from 380,000 to 600,000, estimates Citizens Advice) was obviously caused by the surge in energy bills and magistrates’ willingness to sign off entry warrants in batches. A social tariff for energy , meaning a discounted rate for defined groups of vulnerable customers, would be the single reform most likely to lessen the angst around meters. Yet ministers have so far refused even to engage in the debate on a social tariff. They aren’t making Ofgem’s job easier. The regulator has to cope with the hand it is dealt, of course. The new code is obviously an upgrade in terms of protections for customers, but much depends on whether officials have awoken from their slumbers and are ready to hunt down abuses actively. One critical element is how the new “precautionary principle” – an assumption that anybody facing an involuntary installation is likely to be financially vulnerable – is interpreted and policed in practice. We are, though, in unfamiliar territory when bereavement is another of those “medium risk” characteristics that suppliers must assess. So energy companies will be making judgments about how long indebted customers should be given to mourn before a meter is installed? This is not going to be straightforward.",

    "author": "Suzanne Wrack",
    "content": "Jonas Eidevall has expressed frustration at the inconsistencies between the challenges facing Arsenal and Chelsea before their Champions League semi-finals this weekend. The Gunners face a tricky midweek trip to play Manchester United while the Blues’ calendar is clear. Eidevall’s side travel to Leigh for the next instalment in the Women’s Super League title race on Wednesday night before flying to Wolfsburg on Saturday for the Champions League semi-final first leg on Sunday. Related: Women’s Super League: talking points from the weekend’s action Chelsea, who beat Aston Villa on Sunday to secure a place in the FA Cup final, welcome Barcelona to Stamford Bridge on Saturday after a week of preparation and significantly less travel. “I find it very odd that we are the only one of the two English teams that have qualified for the semi‑final that are forced to play before our semi-final,” Eidevall said. “I have a really hard time getting my head around that because it’s almost like you want one of the teams to have a better chance to succeed than the others.” Arsenal’s game against the WSL league leaders, Manchester United, which was due to be played this weekend, was rescheduled on 4 April. On 14 April Chelsea’s game against West Ham was moved to 17 May, three days after they compete in the FA Cup final. “We need to go to Manchester, we need to play well there, and then we need to go to Wolfsburg,” Eidevall said. “Of course, it’s the preference to, like the other team has, have no games at all, to train and just to prepare for the Champions League. I can’t see the reasons for it and it’s something we need to look into. I can’t see the logic.” A WSL spokesperson said: “Arsenal’s Barclays Women’s Super League match against Manchester United was rescheduled for Wednesday 19 April. The fixture was moved, following consultation with both clubs, to avoid clashing with Arsenal’s Uefa Women’s Champions League semi-final this weekend.” The Arsenal manager took time to praise the response of his team to the loss of players to injury this season. Kim Little is the latest to be ruled out for the rest of the campaign with a knee injury. “It would hurt any team to lose a player like Kim, but we have managed during the season to handle the absence of many great football players and we need to show that adaptability again,” he said. “Keeping the key principles in the way we play but adapting to the individuals. “This group of players has responded very well in tough situations, in tough moments we stick together, we stick to the plan, we believe in the way that we play, and that’s going to be even more important here at the end of the season.” The Manchester United manager, Marc Skinner, said he hoped his side had got the rust shown in their 3-2 defeat of Brighton on Saturday “out of our legs” for the visit of Arsenal. “ Arsenal have found their way past Bayern Munich with the same injuries so we know the threat that they have, we know the way Jonas wants to play, we know their adaptations, so it will be a very difficult game regardless [of who they put out],” Skinner said. “It’s a heavyweight contest, one punch from either can knock the other team out so we have to make sure we’re the team that is the aggressor.” Related: Newcastle Women thrill 24,000 crowd but must be perfect to seal promotion Skinner was unhappy with 7,500 tickets being allocated to each of the two sides in the FA Cup final, United and Chelsea, with more than 65,000 tickets already issued for the match at Wembley. “I don’t know how many it is in the men’s game,” he said. “But to give clubs like Chelsea and Manchester United 8,000 tickets to sell, it’s crazy.” Chelsea and Liverpool were allocated 30,500 tickets each for last season’s men’s FA Cup final at Wembley, which has a capacity of 90,000. A spokesperson for the FA said: “The Vitality Women’s FA Cup final is the showpiece event of the women’s domestic season, and to date we have issued over 65,000 tickets. Chelsea and Manchester United have each been issued with an additional 7,500 tickets for their fans. “This is to help meet the likely demand for each club and is almost double the amount of tickets that the finalists received last year.”",

    "title": "Chris Christie derides Ron DeSantis for being outfoxed by Disney",
    "author": "Martin Pengelly",
    "content": "Ron DeSantis’s attacks on Disney and his struggles to bend the entertainment giant to his will show the Florida governor is both not a true conservative and should not be trusted to lead talks with the leaders of China and Russia, a potential rival for the Republican presidential nomination said on Tuesday. Related: Ron DeSantis threatens prison near Disney theme park in latest retaliation “I’ll tell you this much,” Chris Christie told Semafor . “That’s not the guy I want sitting across from President Xi [Jinping] and negotiating our next agreement with China. “Or sitting across from [Vladimir] Putin and trying to resolve what’s happening in Ukraine. If you can’t see around a corner that [Disney chief executive] Bob Iger creates for you, I mean, I don’t think that’s very imposing.” The former governor of New Jersey also said he would decide on his own presidential bid in “the next couple of weeks”. Also expected to announce a run soon, DeSantis is former Republican president Donald Trump’s closest polling rival. But DeSantis’s numbers have stagnated and last weekend a major donor said he was pausing support. DeSantis’s spat with Disney began over its opposition to so-called “don’t say gay” legislation, concerning the teaching of gender and LGBTQ+ issues in public schools. DeSantis retaliated by moving to seize control of self-governing powers long granted to the company. Disney responded with moves to safeguard such powers forever. On Monday, DeSantis accused Disney of perpetrating a legally unsound “sham”, which he said he would dismantle. He also threatened to build on state-owned land next to Disney World. “What should we do with this land?” DeSantis said. “Maybe create a state park. Maybe try to do more amusement parks. Someone even said, like, maybe you need another state prison. Who knows? I just think that the possibilities are endless.” Christie said: “I don’t think Ron DeSantis is a conservative, based on his actions towards Disney. “Where are we headed here now, that if you express disagreement in this country, the government is allowed to punish you? To me, that’s what I always thought liberals did. And now all of a sudden here we are participating in this with a Republican governor.” As well as questioning why DeSantis attacked Disney, Christie blasted how he did it. “For him … to not have foreseen that Disney was going to do what they did in response, which was to completely take over the millions and millions of acres and the zoning decisions on that … well, I’ll tell you this much: that’s not the guy I want sitting across from President Xi.” Rubio uses same line about Obama three times in Republican debate A pugnacious political performer, Christie ran for the Republican nomination in 2016. He failed to make an impact, other than in a debate in New Hampshire in which he flattened the Florida senator Marco Rubio. Related: Republican donor pauses Ron DeSantis funding over abortion and book banning On Tuesday, Christie suggested that if a liberal governor attacked Disney in support of liberal policies Republicans would be outraged, and he added: “Why do you want to punish a place that creates enormous tax revenue, enormous tourism for your state? “… Everyone should have the freedom in this country to disagree with something that government does. And my job as the leader is to convince a majority of people in my state or my country that the criticism is wrong, not to use the power of government that was given to me by the people to punish someone for that.” Notwithstanding the fact that he left office under a cloud over the Bridgegate political payback scandal, and with historically low approval ratings, Christie added: “Sometimes in politics you just have to admit that you screwed up and got taken.”",

    "title": "From ‘lovely’ to ‘disgusting’: mixed views from Brecon on national park rebrand",
    "author": "Steven Morris",
    "content": "On a bright spring day, the Welsh market town of Brecon bustled with life. Visitors browsed the shops, admired the cathedral or grabbed supplies before heading for the hills; farmers stocked up with supplies; residents got on with chores. But one topic of conversation dominated: the whys and wherefores of a controversial rebranding exercise for the mountainous park in which the town sits. The decision by the national park to drop the English name – the Brecon Beacons – in favour of the Welsh one – Bannau Brycheiniog – and ditch its burning brazier emblem is causing a huge debate, not just in rural Wales, but in the corridors of power in Cardiff and Westminster, where Tories have attacked it and No 10 even got stuck in , suggesting the park leaders should be focusing on taking “tangible action” rather than rebranding. Interactive “I personally think the Welsh name is lovely,” said Sue Phair, a co-owner of the Ty Cariad (House of Love) home store in Brecon. “It’s the original name and the better one.” Phair, a Welsh learner, had been chatting with her classmates about the change. “There were nine of us and we were unanimous. That’s its proper name and should be used. One of the ladies pointed out that when you go to the Alps, you don’t look for the White Mountain. You look for Mont Blanc. I don’t get why there’s such a fuss,” she said. Park officials say the name change is partly to show a commitment to the Welsh language, while the old fiery logo did not fit with its determination to tackle the climate and biodiversity emergencies. The new logo is more muted and features nods to starry skies, hills and watercourses. Punch Maughan, the owner of the Found Gallery, said she had been surprised at the scale of the reaction. “But at least it’s got people commenting, thinking about Wales,” she added. Bannau is the plural of “ban”, which means peak in Welsh, while Brycheiniog refers to the kingdom of the fifth-century king Brychan, so the name translates into English as the peaks of Brychan’s kingdom. At the cathedral, the volunteer guide Wynn Davies pointed out a stained-glass window depicting Brychan. “I’m a Welsh speaker and have always known the park as Bannau Brycheiniog,” he said. “I’d much rather the Welsh name was used. After all, we are in Wales.” The topic was being discussed – heatedly – in the backroom of Morgans Family Butchers. “It’s disgusting,” said Steve Morgans, a butcher and town councillor. “My parents, grandparents, great-grandparents all knew it as the Brecon Beacons and the brazier is synonymous with the park. For me, it’s a symbol of love and passion for Wales. Nobody has consulted us about this. Shocking.” A few miles south, at the national park centre, the Brecon Beacons name is still everywhere – on signs, on fridge magnets in the gift shop, even on play equipment. It will be some time before the English name vanishes from its sites. Staff have been taken aback at the vitriol in emails and phone calls, with some people claiming the name change is anti-English and climate science deniers complaining about the scrapping of the brazier symbol. “There’s no climate crisis, but there is a woke agenda crisis,” was one of the more repeatable messages. “You are bed-wetting virtue seekers,” wrote another. Staff are dismayed that the aims of its management plan, including reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions across the park by 2035, have been missed in the row. Countryside Alliance Wales was among naysayers jumping in on Tuesday, claiming that the park wanted to restrict sheep grazing in favour of windfarming – though within the plan, an artist’s impression of the park in 2048 shows sheep and cattle, as well as a small wind turbine. Liz Hutchins, a senior policy adviser for the park, stressed that sheep had a future there and said there seemed to be a lot of fear about the changes. “Change is difficult,” she said. “I don’t think voices that say we need to continue with how things have been run over the last 30 or 40 years are helping farmers, residents and people who live in the national park. I don’t think the status quo is an option.” On the language issue, Aled Edwards, the chair of the park authority, said: “How you approach the Welsh language is a fair weathervane of how you approach difference. It’s not about the language, it’s about the people who speak it and take delight in it.” He said the management plan had substance and ambition. “It’s about living a life that is prosperous and good but doesn’t burn everything around it.” Tourists at the centre were relaxed about the name change. Caroline and Katie Sadler, sisters visiting from the east of England, admitted that they might struggle to use it. “But we’ll try,” said Katie. “You attempt to speak French or Spanish when you go there. Why not Welsh here?”",

    "title": "Sudan: which powers are vying for influence in vast east African country?",
    "author": "Jason Burke",
    "content": "The conflict in Sudan is an internal power struggle, with its roots in the country’s troubled politics over recent decades. Four days of fighting has pitted army units loyal to Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the head of Sudan’s transitional governing sovereign council, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), led by Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo , known as Hemedti, who is deputy head of the council. Their power struggle has derailed a shift to civilian rule and raised fears of a wider conflict. At the same time, a dozen or more regional powers, major actors in the Middle East and geo-political heavyweights have a stake in the fighting raging in Khartoum and elsewhere. The United States, which is the biggest actor, is able to exert influence directly on key individuals, through the withholding or delivery of huge sums of aid, its weight in international forums such as the United Nations or multilateral lenders, and its ability to build coalitions of smaller powers. The US wants stability in a restive region of enormous strategic importance, and also to roll back the growing influence of competitors such as China and, to a much lesser extent, Russia. Washington welcomed the fall of the veteran dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019, but has been criticised for taking too soft a line with the two main military powerbrokers and particularly with Burhan. China has been making a major effort to win friends in east Africa through the construction of major infrastructure, economic investment, loans and support for incumbent rulers who are attracted to its brand of authoritarianism. But although China has ambitions to establish a role as a mediator of consequence across the continent, it is unlikely to have much influence on this conflict. This relative neutrality at least offers Beijing a potential opportunity to build a relationship with any eventual victor. In contrast, Russia is seen as being fully committed to Hemedti and the RSF. The former warlord has been linked to Russian efforts to extract huge amounts of gold from Sudan to help fund the invasion of Ukraine, and Moscow has deployed Wagner group paramilitaries to bolster Hemedti’s operations . Beyond the precious resources, it is Sudan’s strategic position that has attracted Moscow, particularly the chance to position a major naval base there, which would allow operations in the Indian Ocean. Egypt has longstanding ties with Sudan’s military and has made its support for Burhan clear. Egyptian soldiers – or “trainers” – have been taken captive by the RSF in recent days . Cairo wants stability and likes the idea of an authoritarian military man in charge of its vast neighbour. But it also wants the support of Khartoum in its bitter argument with Ethiopia over the control of the flow of the Nile. The Egyptians also want to check the influence of their regional rivals in Sudan. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are also major actors, and their rulers have personal relationships with many of the key figures in Sudan. Both have poured huge sums of money into Sudan since 2019 in an attempt to build a regime favourable to their interests. Hemedti won favour by dispatching thousands of Sudanese fighters to fight in Yemen as part of the Saudi- and Emirati-led coalition there, but Burhan has been welcomed too . Saudi Arabia and the UAE have become much more aligned with western policy in Sudan in recent years. In recent weeks, Riyadh in particular has been active in trying to avert conflict – though without much success, it appears. The European Union is aligned with the US and the United Kingdom in seeking a compromise agreement that would lead to a transition to civilian control . Chaos in Sudan could trigger a new increase in refugees, and France is particularly concerned about the consequences for fragile states farther west where it has already lost much influence in recent years.",

    "author": "Zeinab Mohammed Salih in Omdurman",
    "content": "It took the 16-year-old three days to travel just a handful of miles to get to hospital, and he may have died if the bullet had not made a clean entry and exit out of his body. Moving around the streets of the Sudanese capital has become a life-threatening endeavour. Khartoum descended into an intense city-wide firefight this week, which has also engulfed much of its twin city across the Nile, Omdurman. The teenager, a high school student, was hit while on his way to dawn prayers at the mosque in Omdurman. On Tuesday, he lay in a hospital bed, visibly in pain and accompanied by his uncle, Hamid Adam. “We are lucky that the bullet that hit him went out from the other side of his abdomen,” said Adam. There was heavy fighting around the el-Halfayia bridge, which connects the two cities, he added. “You can’t imagine the smell of the dead people on the streets. Nobody can recover them.” His nephew had been waiting for doctors to decide when to take him into the operating theatre. “He might still have shrapnel inside his body,” his uncle said. For the fourth day, residents of Khartoum and Omdurman have listened in fear to heavy gunfire and explosions, with military jets roaring overhead, as a power struggle plays out between the army and the paramilitaries of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Both have announced that they will uphold a 24-hour ceasefire at the request of US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, but the cities have already suffered badly. A number of hospitals are closed after being hit by shells. Still operational, the Omdurman teaching hospital has received about 300 wounded civilians and soldiers, mostly from Omdurman and north Khartoum, but fewer cases from Khartoum, where the fighting is centred. Some of the wounded are fighters. Many of them did not go to the hospital immediately, but went home first to change their uniforms so that they could not be identified as combatants. Interactive One soldier, aged 23, has been in a critical situation after being shot in his chest and leg, and lay alone in a hospital bed. “My family is too far from here and they don’t know about my situation. I was taken to a different hospital, but that was closed down … but today they got me here.” Khalid el-Sir, the medical manager at the hospital, said medics lack oxygen and supplies because they used to receive them on a daily basis from downtown Khartoum. Now, the bridges are closed and nothing can get across. “It has become impossible to get anything,” he said, as the sound of gunfire and shells rang out outside. “The situation here is devastating now. Since Saturday, we have received more than 300 cases of wounded civilians and soldiers. Thirty died of their wounds. Some of the wounds were in the chest and some of them were in their heads. Among them are small children and women.” El-Sir is worried that his depleted staff will not be able to continue doing their jobs “We lack staff. The ones we have here have been exhausted – they have been working for four days and many of them haven’t seen their families and children since before the start of the war. At some point they will stop working unless things change.” Ibrahim Abbas, a civilian, was shot in his backside and had lost a lot of blood. “I was on my motorbike in Khartoum North and I saw the RSF shot me. I don’t know if it was accidentally or if they meant to shoot.” So dangerous is it to walk around that there are reports of uncovered bodies across the city. Political activist Khalid al-Tageea, who was shot and killed at Khartoum University’s schools of arts, was buried inside the university where he graduated after his family could not reach him. A few people remain on the streets of Omdurman, several carrying luggage and desperate to flee the city. In the safest parts of Omdurman, which are the working-class neighbourhoods, children were seen carrying freshly made biscuits on their heads on big plates to be cooked at nearby public bakeries, in preparation for the Eid festival next week. Others on the streets are intelligence forces in plainclothes with concealed guns. Siddig Salih, a 50-year-old resident of Omdurman, went out in search for medicine for his diabetic mother. All the pharmacies are closed in Omdurman, but he was told that one might still be open near the national TV and radio buildings, the scene of heavy fighting. He said he kept praying on his way to that pharmacy. “I am going there because my mother is critically ill. Why are these generals doing this to us?”",

    "title": "Florence Peake review – riffing and writhing topless on the canvas",
    "author": "Adrian Searle",
    "content": "On hands and knees, her paint-scuffed boiler suit pulled down to her waist and her breasts bared, the dancer is being covered with paint. She jolts as the cold paint hits her, hands smearing it on to her torso and down her back,finger-painting it over her face. I thought the dancer was about to have her wet body pressed on to the canvas she was crouching on, just like one of Yves Klein’s living female stencils in his highly theatrical Anthropometries live painting-performances made over 60 years ago. Instead, Florence Peake’s performer has a microphone shoved in her face and she begins reading the first of several hand-transcribed fragments of art historical commentary, going on about solipsistic pleasures and the abstract surface, grim parodies of sexual union and something about Cézanne’s 1877 painting The Eternal Feminine . It is all a jumble of windy wordage culled from the art books and catalogues whose open pages are strewn about on the floor nearby. All these books on Titian, Courbet, Vermeer, Magritte, Pollock, and other white male canonical artists – and their equally canonical critics – are the sort of thing painters or art historians might keep lying about the place to give them inspiration or a bit of intellectual heft. Luckily, Peake’s Factual Actual uses the text as a kind of parody. Originally performed at the National Gallery in 2021 where there was no nudity and no paint slathering – that was left to the Titians and Tintorettos on the oxblood-red walls in the nearby rooms – Peake has extended and developed the work in the bare and dramatic space of Dilston Grove, a former Clare College Mission Church on the edge of London’s Southwark Park. Her show there is a performance about painting, and painting as performance. Painting always has this performative aspect. The painter going back and forth to their canvas, pacing between the turps and the rags, the painted bodies and their live models; all the muttering and squinting and sighing, the carting about of stretchers and bolts of canvas, the clattering and hammering and cursing, the method-acting, the torment, the high seriousness and low humour. All that activity, somehow, has worked its way into the gestures and movements and sounds of the work. Seven large, unstretched canvases are hung by arrangements of pulleys and ropes from the beams of the high, vaulted space. Sporadically raised and lowered by Peake’s performers, who bend to their ropes, pulling and leaning like yacht crews to their sheets, the canvases ascend, descend and are laid flat on the white, reflective dancefloor that has been installed the length of the nave. The canvases are covered in paint: slovenly blue skies, rough yellow deserts, purplish expanses and bits of bodies. Sometimes the dancers are exposed; at others they hide under them, or are wrapped in their folds. Here’s a live foot, there’s a painted arm. The canvases slide on the dancefloor as they’re moved from position to position, making a sound like a tide sliding over a beach. One minute they’re shrouds, the next sails or a row of humanoid bundles. At times the action breaks into slapstick. One dancer makes her way from one end of the nave to the other, encumbered by painting stretchers whose canvases have been torn off. She trips and stumbles, gets her legs entangled as she clambers between the wooden frames, banging and clattering along. She’s like some sort of mendicant, or a painter dragging their history with them. I’m sure I looked just as absurd, all those years I was trying to be a painter. It is both painful and funny to watch. Another character has her head and torso hidden behind a complicated mask, whose layers and planes are a jumble of florid, painted shapes. The moiling brushwork depicts guts and emotional turmoil, all of it topped by a big pink brain. She can barely get about unaided. At one point she takes a microphone and drags it over her costume. The rustling and scraping is picked up by a tape-loop machine that turns the sound into a kind of repetitive musique concrète. Other performers take the mic and add to the soundscape. There are whoops, rustlings, oceanic surges, scrapings. I think I hear tap-dancing. All this takes place with the lovely daylight falling through the high windows. There’s an odd sense of open-ended ritual, and ideally I’d like the performance to keep on developing, hour after hour, day after day. Who knows where it might lead? Instead, a limited number of performances will take place over the show’s run, before it travels to the Towner Eastbourne , and the Fruitmarket in Edinburgh. Peake dedicates her show to her mother, the sculptor Phyllida Barlow, who died last month , and it is impossible not to see the trace of Barlow’s own performative approach to materiality, space and making in Peake’s work. Her sister Clover also worked on the costumes. It is a family affair. Across the park, in the smaller Lake Gallery, the walls are completely covered by a scroll-like canvas. Forty-five metres long, Ensemble has its origins in a series of workshops Peake conducted last winter with local community groups. She involved the participants in a kind of mark-making process derived from what is described as a kind of dance technique. Whatever trace of this activity is left in the canvas is hard to tell. Peake reworked the canvas back in her studio, riffing on the marks and gestures that had already been made there. There are bodies and bits of bodies everywhere. Here a group of hands, there an inverted figure, now a jumble of clustered limbs, areas of darkness and swipes and blobs and delicate scrabbling drawing. As with Factual Actual, it all feels open-ended, and not so much incomplete as suspended. What a performance it all is. • Florence Peake’s Factual Actual: Ensemble is at Southwark Park Galleries, London, until 2 July.",

    "title": "SNP in ‘total meltdown’ following arrests and party funding investigation, say Scottish Tories – as it happened",
    "author": "Andrew Sparrow",
    "content": "5.53pm BST Afternoon summary Scotland’s new first minister, Humza Yousaf, has set out a “fresh vision” for his next three years in government that delays, redraws or reverses a number of his predecessor Nicola Sturgeon’s key policies . But, as Libby Brooks reports, opposition leaders said any attempt at a relaunch had been “utterly torpedoed” by the arrest earlier on Tuesday of the SNP treasurer, Colin Beattie , amid the ongoing police investigation into the party’s funding and finances. The senior Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood has accused the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, of concealing a potential Russian “act of war” against an RAF spy plane, during an emergency debate in the Commons. The energy secretary, Grant Shapps, has urged Ofgem to turn words “into action” to ensure new industry rules designed to protect vulnerable people from being forced on to prepayment meters are properly enforced. The government is considering issuing guidance to single-sex schools in England saying that they cannot be legally obliged to take transgender pupils, as part of advice to be released this term. 5.29pm BST Ministers ignored advice that would have stopped prisoners dying during Covid pandemic, MPs told Ministers have not done enough to prevent deaths of prisoners in England and Wales, an independent reviewer has said. Juliet Lyon, the chair of the Independent Advisory Panel on Deaths in Custody until January this year, said ministers had ignored advice which would have helped to protect detainees during Covid, and the current state of prisons was “awful”. Giving evidence to the Commons justice committee this afternoon, Lyon was asked if the government had done enough to protect prisoners during the Covid pandemic. She replied: No ... They made a very rapid choice, as you know, to lock everyone down as their best way of trying to keep people safe. There were other choices that could have been made. She said there had been talk of releasing 4,000 vulnerable prisoners during the pandemic, but in fact only 262 were released. Lyon said ministers ignored strong clinical advice that there should have been universal vaccination in prisons, as happened in care homes, because it was “not considered politically palatable”. She told the committee: That was a real revelation to me that ministers couldn’t accept the advice that was coming from every quarter because they feared that the public wouldn’t find it acceptable. I don’t believe that was a good enough reason to put people’s lives at risk. The deprivations that happened particularly during Covid and the extreme imprisonment and the choices that were made to hold people in isolation, have ... continued in some shape or form. Lyon suggested it would “concentrate minds” if ministers were made to apologise to families bereaved as a result of a death in custody. Ending her evidence to the committee on a sombre note, she said: Until and unless the prison service is able to be properly staffed and properly resourced and seen as a really important public service, with all that that involves, it’s really difficult for them to keep people safe. Updated at 5.36pm BST 5.20pm BST DUP says Chris Heaton-Harris sounded like 'clueless Irish American' in 'patronising' speech on unionism The DUP has just sent out a statement accusing Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, of being “patronising” and sounding like “a clueless Irish American congressman” in his speech this morning. (See 10.27am. ) Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader, was implicitly critical earlier (see 5pm) , but DUP HQ has now sent out a formal response, in the form of a statement from the DUP MP Gavin Robinson . Robinson says: The [Northern Ireland Office’s] approach today has been patronising towards unionist concerns and stands in contrast to their approach when Sinn Féin blocked devolved government for three years over the Irish language. The government must realise that getting the foundations right, supported by unionists as well as nationalists, rather than personal attacks and blackmail will restore Stormont. The secretary of state’s rhetoric for the [Queen’s University Belfast] audience was more akin to a speech by a clueless Irish American congressman rather than a UK government cabinet minister. This is about taking our time to get it right. We need stable and sustainable devolved government. For those who have forgotten, over the last 25 years, political progress in NI was hard won and is built on the foundation of support from unionists and nationalists. Not one unionist MLA supported the NI protocol and that was the critical mistake. There is no solid basis for an executive and assembly until we have arrangements that restore NI’s place in the UK internal market and our constitutional arrangements are respected.

The US president, Joe Biden, made that point last week as diplomatically as he could . Yesterday George Mitchell, who chaired the talks leading up to the Good Friday agreement, made a moving appeal for compromise . Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, was more explicit this morning (see 10.27am) , although he never referred directly to the DUP in his speech . But Sir Jeffrey Donaldon, the DUP leader, says his party will not respond to lectures from “the great and the good”. He has tweeted a message implying his party will continue its boycott of Stormont until it gets further assurances on power sharing. Well said @little_pengelly The great and the good can lecture us all they want for a cheap round of applause but it won’t change the political reality.

He already looks like a defeated man. — Alex Cole-Hamilton MSP🔶🇺🇦 (@agcolehamilton) April 18, 2023 4.02pm BST The government has today announced a new crackdown on dangerous knives. It was briefed overnight, and this prompted complaints that Tory home secretaries have been making near-identical announcements for years. (See 11.47am.) In his statement to MPs Chris Philp , the policing minister, said that the new measures would go beyond what was already on the statute book. The Offensive Weapons Act 2019 banned some of these weapons, but today’s measures will close loopholes in that legislation, he explained. To follow the details, you need to understand the difference between “zombie knives”, which are already banned, and “zombie-style knives”, which are not – but which will be, under the proposals being announced today. A “zombie knife” is a blade with a cutting edge, a serrated edge and “images or words that suggest that it is to be used for the purpose of violence”. A “zombie-style knife” is one that looks the same, but does not have the violent words or pictures on it. Full details of the proposal are in the Home Office’s consultation document.

He confirmed that a vote on the national care service bill was being delayed again , until the autumn. And he said that Scotland would be rejoining two international schemes allowing educational outcomes to be compared across countries. This is from ITV Border’s Peter MacMahon.

He says Yousaf “is not running a functioning government”. He goes on: “This is an SMP that is mired in scandal, mired in division.” The current scandal is a consequence of 16 years of command and control, and “lack of transparency”. Yousaf criticises Sarwar for not asking about policy. He says Sarwar is a “master of the soundbite”, but “vacuous”. He says a Keir Starmer administration would be “a pale immitation of a Tory government”. UPDATE: Sarwar said: What Humza Yousaf can’t escape from is that he is not now running a functioning government. This is an SNP that is mired in scandal, mired in division, talking to themselves about themselves. And the crisis that now engulfs the SNP is not just an indication of how they govern their party, but also how they govern our country. A 16-year culture of command and control, of financial mismanagement, and a lack of transparency, meaning secrecy and cover-ups, often with devastating consequences. And no amount of spin or the pretence of a reset or a fresh start is going to hide what is now becoming clearer to the public every single day. Our country is now crying out for leadership, for hope, for new ideas and a new vision to confront the twin crises our nation faces – a cost of living crisis … and an NHS crisis. Continuity won’t cut it. Incompetence has consequences. And, frankly, Scotland deserves better.

Meghan Gallacher , the deputy leader of the Scottish Conservatives, says the SNP is in “total meltdown”. She claims that Yousaf will not suspend SNP figures involved in the affairs being investigated by the police because they are his mentors. UPDATE: Gallacher said: The first minister makes this statement today as scandal continues to engulf his party. The SNP is in total meltdown. Its former chief executive and now its treasurer have been arrested amid a police investigation into the party’s finances. And leaked footage has shown Nicola Sturgeon trying to shut down scrutiny mere months before the investigation began. Yet Humza Yousaf is so indebted to his former mentors that he will not do the right thing and suspend them while the investigation is ongoing. It is high time that Humza Yousaf tackled this scandal head on and proved to the Scottish public that he has his own man, instead of defending and deflecting from his predecessor’s tarnished legacy.

But it is “the honour of my life”, he says. And he says the government is publishing a prospectus today setting out its plans. There are three missions, built around the themes of equality, opportunity and community, he says. On equality, he says the government will commit to continuing to tackle poverty in all its forms, and to substantially reducing poverty. Updated at 5.55pm BST 2.23pm BST Former SNP leadership candidate Ash Regan says she has 'some sympathy' with people saying contest should be rerun Ash Regan , who came last out of three in the SNP leadership contest, told Radio 4’s The World at One that she had “some sympathy” with those members who were saying the internal party turmoil meant the leadership contest should be re-run. She said she was not calling for that herself. But she said that “some people” were making that argument, and she went on: “I do have some sympathy with that argument.” She said that during the contest, when it turned out that the party had previously lied to the media about the size of the membership, she had argued for members to be allowed to change their vote, if they had already voted. That was not allowed. But if it had, “we might be in a different situation”, Regan told The World at One. The argument for rerunning the contest is based on the idea that, if members had known the full extent of the problems allowed to accumulate under Nicola Sturgeon’s leadership, they might have been less keen to vote for the person most seen as the continuity candidate, Humza Yousaf. Updated at 2.39pm BST 2.04pm BST Humza Yousaf rules out suspending SNP treasurer arrested by police, and says he does not think party now acting criminally Humza Yousaf is giving a speech to the Scottish parliament this afternoon that was billed as the launch of his new administration’s programme. Beforehand, the first minister found himself having to asssure journalists that he did not believe the SNP is operating as a criminal enterprise right now. That was one of the questions put to him in a brief Q&A with journalists. Here are the main points. Yousaf said he was “surprised” to learn that Colin Beattie, the SNP treasurer, had been arrested. He said he did not think the SNP was acting in a criminal way. Asked if he could guarante that the party was not “operating in a criminal way right now, since you became leader”, he replied: “I don’t believe it is at all.” He said he had ordered a review to into transparency and good governance. The party had to change the way it operated, he said. He appeared to rule out suspending Beattie, saying he took the view that people are “people are innocent until proven guilty”. But he said he would consider removing Beattie from the the Holyrood’s public audit committe. Asked if he would do this, he said: I’ll consider that. I have to speak to Colin Beattie. My understanding is he is still in the police station being questioned. When he’s off that, I need to have a word with Colin, not about the live police investigation, we can’t speak about the detail of that, but clearly there are pertinent issues around his role on the public audit committee and his role, of course, as the national treasurer. He described Beattie’s arrest as “not helpful” given he is making a statement to MSPs about his government’s priorities later. This is from Sky’s Connor Gillies.

But on Times Radio this morning William Hague , the former Tory leader, said WI members unhappy with the policy should “get used” to the fact that trans women are part of society now. He said: I think on this issue, there are some areas where there’s been a danger of going too fast, competitive sport is one of them. And world athletics has made clear that women in women’s sport can’t be transgender, otherwise it would be the end of women’s sport. And I think that is quite right. I’m not sure that applies to the Women’s Institute, though. There are transgender people, they have changed their gender. This is part of our society now. And I think large national organisations like the WI have to get over that and get used to that, and welcome new people. So that would be the side of the argument I’m on. I’ll probably get a lot of angry letters now from the from WI members but I would be on that side of the argument. At the Downing Street lobby briefing the PM’s spokesperson was asked about Hague’s comment, and whether Rishi Sunak was also on that side of the argument. The spokesperson implied, not quite. The spokesperson said he had not seen Hague’s comments, and that it was for the groups like the WI to decide for themselves who their members should be. He went on: The prime minister has said that it is vitally important that transgender people are treated with compassion at all times as a starting point … But it will for a specific group to decide [what its policy is]. Updated at 1.34pm BST 12.59pm BST Sunak says he wants UK to be at 'forefront' of artificial intelligence, as GCHQ chief briefs cabinet on benefits and risks Sir Jeremy Fleming, the director of GCHQ, the government’s secret surveillance centre, briefed cabinet ministers this morning on the potential benefits and risks of artificial intelligence. Dame Angela McLean, the government’s chief scientific adviser, and Michelle Donelan, the culture secretary, also contributed to the discussion, No 10 said. There is increasing concern around the world that AI is developing so rapidly that a system could emerge that might pose a threat to the human race. Elon Musk was one of many AI pioneers who recently signed an open letter calling for six-month pause in the development of the most powerful AI technologies, saying: “Recent months have seen AI labs locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one – not even their creators – can understand, predict, or reliably control.” According to the Downing Street readout from cabinet, while ministers discussed the pros and cons, Rishi Sunak told his team that he wants the UK to be at the forefront of this technology. No 10 said: The prime minister said he wants the UK to be at the forefront of [science and technology] on the world stage so the UK reaps the economic and social benefits. He added that in no other area is this more important than artificial intelligence … Cabinet agreed on the transformative potential of AI and the vital importance of retaining public confidence in its use and the need for regulation that keeps people safe without preventing innovation. The prime minister emphasised that we need to ensure we remain competitive, which is why we confirmed our intention i n the integrated review refresh to establish a new government industry taskforce on foundation models . It will be modelled on the vaccines taskforce. The prime minister concluded cabinet by saying that given the importance of artificial intelligence to our economy and national security, this could be one of the most important policies we pursue in the next few years which is why we must get it right.

As PA Media reports, the cumulative number of Channel crossings this year is currently running below the level for 2022. At the equivalent point last year, the number of crossings stood at just over 6,300. At the Downing Street lobby briefing the PM’s spokesperson rejected suggestions that the measures announced so far were failing to have a deterrent effect on small boat crossings. The spokesperson said: I think it’s too early to draw conclusions at this stage … So I think it will be the culmination of all the different policies we are introducing which will have a long-lasting impact. He said the partnership with Rwanda, the legislation being introduced and the deal with the French to increase the number of small boats being stopped would all have an impact. Updated at 1.02pm BST 12.27pm BST Starmer says SNP in 'real mess' and Scotland deserves better Keir Starmer has said the SNP is in a “real mess” and letting down the people of Scotland. Asked to comment on the arrest of the SNP’s treasurer, Starmer told journalists: The SNP developments are deeply concerning. Obviously there is a criminal investigation going on, so there is only so much I can say. But after 16 years in power, it has descended to this – a real mess – and those being let down are Scottish voters who are entitled to better than this. And if anything makes the case for change clear it is what is happening with the SNP just at the moment. Scotland deserves better and with Labour they would get better. 12.24pm BST No 10 resists calls from Starmer for Sunak to publish his entry in list of ministers' interests today Keir Starmer has urged Rishi Sunak to publish his entry in the register of ministerial interests today. Speaking at the University of York, Starmer said: The prime minister promised integrity and accountability when he came into office so I think he needs to clear this up and declare his interests. The register of ministerial interests hasn’t been published for nearly a year so I invite the prime minister to publish, at least, his entry on this issue today, clear this up, because he promised transparency. Don’t hide behind the process, just come clean and tell everybody what the interest is so people can see it and judge it. That’s what transparency is. At the Downing Street lobby briefing the PM’s spokesperson said Sir Laurie Magnus, the independent adviser on ministers’ interests (who is more commonly known as the No 10 ethics adviser), would be publishing the updated list of ministers interests, and that he wanted to do this “as quickly as possible”. The work was still ongoing, the spokesperson said. Asked if Sunak would publish his own personal entry before the publication of the full list, the spokesperson said he was not aware of any plans to do that. Updated at 3.00pm BST 12.07pm BST Colin Beattie: profile of SNP treasurer arrested as part of police investigation into SNP finances PA Media has filed a profile of Colin Beattie , the SNP treasurer arrested as part of the police investigation into SNP finances. PA says: Originally working in international finance, a biography on his website claims Beattie spent 23 years living in the “Middle and Far East”, followed by 11 years in London, before settling in Dalkeith, Midlothian in 2001 with his wife Lisa – a former leader of the local authority. First elected as a councillor in Midlothian in 2007, Beattie led the SNP group at the local authority. But in 2011, he moved to Holyrood, being elected as an MSP for the newly-formed Midlothian North and Musselburgh constituency. Despite the SNP being in power throughout his tenure as an MSP, Beattie has never achieved ministerial office, having never been invited by Alex Salmond, Nicola Sturgeon or Humza Yousaf to serve in government. His highest office to date has been the national treasurer post, a role he was elected to in a vote by party members in 2004. In the party’s 2020 internal elections, however, Beattie lost out to MP Douglas Chapman. But Chapman’s tenure would be short-lived, with him resigning in May 2021, claiming he had not been given enough information to carry out the job. The following month, Beattie was reinstated to the role. But, in July 2021, Police Scotland opened an investigation into the use of about £600,000 of donations received by the party as part of a fundraising effort to finance an independence referendum campaign. In August 2021, Beattie sought to reassure members in a statement released alongside the party’s accounts, saying: “There has been concern expressed in some quarters that this system does not result in a separate fund being officially recorded in the annual accounts of the party. “Hence a claim from some that the money does not exist. “In fact, the money is earmarked through the internal process set out above and will be deployed fully through future cash flow for the purpose of promoting a referendum on independence and campaigns intended to secure independence.” He continued: “While these monies are not separated out, their existence in terms of the commitment as to what they will be spent on is tangible.” 11.59am BST Scottish Labour challenges Yousaf to explain why SNP treasurer has not been suspended The Scottish Labour party is also calling for the suspension of Colin Beattie, the SNP treasurer arrested by the police. Jackie Baillie, the Scottish Labour deputy leader, said: For too long, a culture of secrecy and cover-up has been allowed to fester at the heart of the SNP. And while the investigation spreads, the SNP is still refusing to take the basic step of suspending MSPs who are the subject of police inquiries. Humza Yousaf’s inaction raises questions - is his priority the cover up to protect the SNP or the people of Scotland? 11.47am BST Labour says crackdown on sale of zombie knives being announced today should have happened years ago Chris Philp , the policing minister, will make a statement later about Home Office plans to ban the sale of so-called zombie knives. In time-honoured fashion, MPs will hear the details some hours after they were disclosed to readers of the Sun, which has published an article by Philp . He says: There is no legitimate reason for someone to carry a machete or zombie knife on the streets of Britain. These knives, which have no practical purpose, are carried by criminals. So-called ‘Rambo’ and ‘zombie style’ knives, spark fear and can cause unimaginable harm. They are often used to intimidate victims as part of a street mugging for a phone or a watch or used by drug gangs on the streets. That is why we are moving to ban all these terrifying weapons. The Home Office has also tweeted about the plans. ⚠️ Machetes and other menacing knives have no place on our streets.

In a statement Craig Hoy , the Scottish Conservative chair, said: The police investigation into the SNP’s murky finances is consuming the party – and Humza Yousaf has to get a grip of the situation, rather than stand by wringing his hands. He must show some leadership and suspend Colin Beattie – along with Peter Murrell and Nicola Sturgeon. That is the precedent the party set when politicians such as Michelle Thomson and Natalie McGarry were under investigation – and it must be followed here, for the benefit of everyone. Colin Beattie should also stand down from membership of the public audit committee until the conclusion of the investigation.

Related: SNP treasurer arrested in party funding investigation And this is what he says about the police investigation that led to the arrest of the party’s treasurer. The police investigation was launched in 2021 after complaints were made about the SNP’s handling of over £600,000 in donations given to the party, ostensibly for a fresh independence referendum campaign launched in 2019. It emerged that money was not put into a separate, segregated SNP account but Sturgeon said it was all accounted for, and the equivalent figure would be spent by the party on that referendum campaign. Speaking in 2021, Sturgeon said: “Money hasn’t gone missing; all money goes through the SNP accounts independently all fully audited. “We don’t hold separate accounts – we’re under no legal requirement to do that. Our accounts are managed on a cashflow basis, but every penny we raise to support the campaign for independence will be spent on the campaign for independence.” So far, no campaign has been launched. Last week it emerged that Johnston Carmichael, the accountancy firm, quit as the SNP’s external auditors. 10.27am BST Power-sharing 'surest way' to maintain union, Northern Ireland secretary Chris Heaton-Harris tells DUP Chris Heaton-Harris , the Northern Ireland secretary, has used a speech in Belfast to urge the DUP to resume power-sharing. Here are some of the key lines from what he said at the Queen’s University conference to mark the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday agreement. Heaton-Harris said power-sharing was “the surest way” to maintain the union. He explained: The simple reality is that people tend to change the status quo only when the status quo is not working, or people simply stop making the case for it. Devolved power-sharing institutions created a status quo that those of us who value Northern Ireland’s place in the union can robustly and successfully promote and celebrate. So let no one tell you that power-sharing is at any way at odds with unionism. Instead it is the surest way by which Northern Ireland’s place in the union can be secured. This line was applauded by the audience. He said the “biggest threat” to the union was failure to deliver on what people wanted. Government in Northern Ireland has not been functioning properly since the DUP pulled out of the executive early last year, meaning power-sharing cannot operate. Government agencies are still functioning, but important decisions are being postponed, and decisions are being taken by officials, or by London, not by Northern Ireland’s politicians. Heaton-Harris said: The people of Northern Ireland are rightly demanding better, more responsive public services, greater economic prosperity and a brighter future for their children. The biggest threat to Northern Ireland’s place in the union is failing to deliver on these priorities. He said claims that the Good Friday agreement was bad for unionism were wrong. He said he had been struck by a narrative that has “become louder in recent years – a narrative that the agreement struck in 1998 did not achieve great things for unionism”. He went on: That it was somehow all-out wins for nationalism. That narrative is wrong. And all of those, all of us who support the agreement, must be vocal in countering it. Today, the principle of consent is so often taken for granted but it was an important and hard-won guarantee that settled Northern Ireland to remain as part of the United Kingdom. He said leadership was about saying yes. Unionism has been associated with saying no at least since the 1980s , but Heaton-Harris said: Like David Trimble, David Ervine before in 1998, Dr Paisley in 2006, real leadership is about knowing when to say yes and having the courage to do so. Updated at 10.47am BST 9.54am BST I’m afraid we have had to turn off comments because of the risk of people posting prejudicial matter in relation to the story about the arrest of the SNP’s treasurer. It is possible they may reopen later in the day. In the meantime, if you want to message me directly, do try the ‘send us a message’ feature, which you will find beneath the byline, on the left of the screen if you are reading on a PC or a laptop. 9.49am BST The arrest of the SNP’s treasurer (see 9.30am) is obviously a gift for Scottish Labour. The party has this morning posted this on Twitter, highlighting a speech Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, gave yesterday. Scotland deserves better than the divided and distracted SNP. We need an election now. https://t.co/2jgy0vOlgH — Scottish Labour (@ScottishLabour) April 18, 2023 Updated at 5.54pm BST 9.42am BST Last night the Scottish government released an extract from the statement Humza Yousaf will deliver to MSPs today about his priorities for government. He will say: In just under three weeks, this government has tripled our support for households struggling with high energy bills with our £30m fuel insecurity fund, announced an additional £25m to help the north-east become the net zero capital of the world, and reinforced our commitment to supporting families with a £15m investment in free high-quality school age childcare. These measures will make a real difference, and have come as a response to the challenges presented by our ongoing recovery from the Covid pandemic and a cost of living crisis exacerbated by Brexit and the UK government’s economic mismanagement, as well as climate change impacts and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine … My cabinet has considered how we can build a better future for Scotland and the outcomes necessary to achieve that – through a determined focus on reducing poverty and strengthening public services, seizing the opportunity to build a growing and green wellbeing economy through the net zero transition and supporting business, and reaffirming our commitment to equality, inclusion, and human rights in everything we do. We will do so using the powers of devolution to their maximum, whilst making the case that as an independent nation, we can do so much more to make Scotland a wealthier, fairer, and greener country. Yousaf is also due to publish a policy prospectus for his government. Updated at 9.50am BST 9.38am BST Today was meant to be the day Humza Yousaf, the new SNP leader and Scottish first minister, performed a government relaunch. He is due to address the Scottish parliament this afternoon to set out his priorities for Scotland. But instead the news is dominated by another SNP arrest. This is from the Scottish commentator Iain Macwhirter. Another arrest. Party treasurer Colin Beattie taken into custody in campervangate. On the very day of Humza's big speech to parliament. He must feel fate has it in for him. Me on what he'll say. Or not say. https://t.co/p1vrqRegWV — Iain Macwhirter (@iainmacwhirter) April 18, 2023 And this is from the Herald’s Tom Gordon. So much for Humza's reset day SNP treasurer arrested https://t.co/w1IDlCzpvc — Tom Gordon (@HTScotPol) April 18, 2023 9.30am BST SNP treasurer Colin Beattie arrested by Scottish police as part of probe into party's funding and finances The SNP’s treasurer, Colin Beattie , has been arrested in connection with the ongoing investigation into the funding and finances of the Scottish National party, Police Scotland has announced. A Police Scotland statement said: A 71-year-old man has today, Tuesday, 18 April 2023, been arrested as a suspect in connection with the ongoing investigation into the funding and finances of the Scottish National party. The man is in custody and is being questioned by Police Scotland detectives. A report will be sent to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service. The matter is active for the purposes of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 and the public are therefore advised to exercise caution if discussing it on social media. As the investigation is ongoing we are unable to comment further. A 71-year-old man has today, Tuesday, 18 April 2023, been arrested as a suspect in connection with the ongoing investigation into the funding and finances of the Scottish National Party. https://t.co/crTiTkBNTH pic.twitter.com/Pm3vwsQhqm — Police Scotland (@PoliceScotland) April 18, 2023 The SNP has been in crisis since Nicola Sturgeon stepped down as first minister, and the police intensified their investigation into mishandling of party finances. To what extent Sturgeon’s resignation was linked to the party’s financial problems remains unclear, but last week her husband, Peter Murrell, who had been the SNP’s chief executive while she was leader, was arrested by police as part of the same investigation. He was released without being charged pending further investigations. Updated at 9.34am BST 9.21am BST Rishi Sunak’s integrity not in doubt, despite inquiry by parliament watchdog, says minister Good morning. Rishi Sunak will be chairing cabinet this morning, in the awkward position of having joined the list of MPs being investigated by the parliamentary commissioner for standards. Chris Philp , the policing minister, has been giving interviews this morning and he told GB News that Sunak’s integrity was not in doubt. Referring to Sunak’s appearance at the liaison committee last month, and an evasive answer that triggered the complaint to the standards commissioner, Philp said: I think no one really doubts Rishi’s integrity and ethics. He has declared his wife’s interests in his ministerial declaration. He did draw attention to that to the committee when he gave evidence and he also wrote to them subsequently as well. He will work with the standards commissioner to clear up any questions that are outstanding. But I don’t think there’s anything sinister here, he has made his declaration. Philp’s account rather glosses over the fact that, when Sunak, as he puts it, drew the committee’s attention to the fact that he had relevant interests to declare, what Sunak actually said was that he did not have anything to declare. And such declarations as he had made had been made in private, for publication in a document (the updated list of ministers’ interests) that is still not out. That is hardly a good example of the “accountability” he promised when he took office. In her London Playbook briefing for Politico, Rosa Prince says No 10 is confident Sunak will be cleared and quotes this defence from an insider. A government official suggested that Sunak had not been asked a specific question about Koru Kids, and could not be expected to be across every firm his wife invested in, given her wide range of financial interests. He told the committee he had made all the correct declarations because he had lodged his wife’s financial affairs with the Cabinet Office. And the fact that the register of interests has not been published in over a year is a result of the high turnover of ministers in recent months, and the fact there was no independent adviser until recently. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.15am: Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, gives a speech at the Queen’s University Belfast conference on the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday agreement. Morning: Rishi Sunak chairs cabinet. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. Morning: Keir Starmer is campaigning in York. 12.15pm: Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, gives a speech to the Scottish TUC conference in Dundee. 2.20pm: Humza Yousaf, Scotland’s new first minister, gives a statement to MSPs setting out his priorities for government. Also, James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, is at the G7 foreign ministers’ meeting in Japan, and Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, is in Washington.

    "title": "England players to be given new social media guidelines after Nowell charge",
    "author": "Gerard Meagher",
    "content": "England players will be given fresh instructions over their use of social media during the World Cup in France this year but will not be banned from using it, the Guardian understands, with Jack Nowell the latest international to find himself in hot water. As flagged by the Guardian, the Rugby Football Union has charged Nowell for his criticism of the referee Karl Dickson following Olly Woodburn’s red card in Exeter’s defeat by Leicester on Sunday. Nowell was one of several non-playing Exeter squad members to air his views on social media and the 30-year-old will now face a disciplinary hearing on Wednesday. Related: The Breakdown | Rugby’s rickety structure leaves Championship’s future up in the air Nowell has been charged with conduct prejudicial to the interests of the union and the game after tweeting: “I’m actually in shock, like shock shocked. What the hell is happening? That’s one of the worst decisions I’ve ever seen. EVER.” The tweet has since been deleted but the RFU made mention of how it was posted to Nowell’s 61,000‑plus followers. Exeter will nervously await the outcome with their Champions Cup semi-final against La Rochelle on the horizon because a suspension could rule Nowell out of the match. Precedent suggests that Nowell will escape a suspension – his England teammate Anthony Watson faced a similar charge in November 2021 and was handed a one-week suspended ban – but the RFU is seeking to clamp down on criticism and abuse of match officials. The disciplinary judgment for Watson noted the absence of an RFU social media policy and urged the union to introduce one at the time. It is understood that all England players, including those in the pathway, are given guidance whenever they come into camp. Furthermore, it is understood that the England squad will be given renewed guidance “in line with Rugby World Cup regulations” before the tournament in France but players will not be banned from using social media during the tournament. World Rugby’s regulations state that “all unions, associations, rugby bodies, clubs and persons shall not publish or cause to be published criticism of the manner in which a match official handled a match”. In the past, Nathan Hughes and Billy Vunipola have also found themselves in hot water for their social media use – the former for criticising a disciplinary panel, the latter for apparently defending Israel Folau’s homophobic remarks . An RFU spokesperson said: “We regularly communicate with the game about rugby’s values, respect being one of those, and the importance of demonstrating this to our match officials.” Nowell and other Exeter players watching their teammates against Leicester were evidently infuriated by Dickson’s decision to show Woodburn a second yellow card. Woodburn’s first yellow was shown for a deliberate knock-on in the first half and he was given his marching orders by Dickson for diving on Chris Ashton on the floor early in the second. The Leicester wing was attempting to score in the right-hand corner as he was tackled by Stuart Hogg, with Woodburn diving at Ashton in an effort to force him into touch. Ashton’s foot grazed the touchline before he could score the try so Dickson ruled that a penalty try should be awarded with Woodburn shown another yellow card. Luke Cowan-Dickie, the England and Exeter hooker, added his opinion that “rugby had lost the plot” while the centre Henry Slade announced “I have no words”, but, in directly criticising the referee’s decision, Nowell has been charged.",

    "title": "Anne Perry obituary",
    "author": "Michael Carlson",
    "content": "Anne Perry, who has died aged 84, was a prolific and bestselling historical crime novelist whose own dramatic criminal history came to light 15 years after her first book was published. Perry’s debut Victorian-era mystery, in which the Scotland Yard inspector Thomas Pitt finds both the killer and an upper-class wife, was published in 1979. By 1994 she had written 13 more Pitt novels, along with five in another series set 30 years earlier, starring the amnesiac private sleuth William Monk and his wife, Hester Latterly, a former nurse in the Crimean war. Also in that year Peter Jackson’s movie Heavenly Creatures was released, starring Kate Winslet as Juliet Hulme, a 15-year-old who helped her friend Pauline Parker kill Parker’s mother, Honorah, in one of New Zealand’s most notorious murder cases. The girls, too young to be hanged, each served five-year sentences and had taken new identities after their release. Journalists soon discovered that Juliet was, in fact, Anne Perry, living quietly with her mother in Portmahomack, a small coastal village north of Inverness. “I knew nothing about [the film] until the day before its release, and all I could think of was that my life would fall apart and it would kill my mother,” Perry said. She claimed to have cut off relationships rather than risk revealing her past; now she discovered after the revelations that “not a single friend was gone” – something that “surprised the hell out of me”. In addition, the publicity and notoriety, if anything, increased sales. She went on to have more than 100 books published, including 32 novels in the Pitt series and another six about Thomas’s son Daniel; 24 Monk and Latterly novels, and 20 annual novellas with a Christmas theme. Her first world war series, No Graves As Yet, grew from a short story, Heroes, which won an Edgar award in 2000. In all, more than 26m copies of her books have been sold worldwide. Perry – Juliet Hulme – was born just before the second world war in Blackheath, south-east London, while her father, Henry Hulme, was working at the Royal Observatory in nearby Greenwich. He had been a prize-winning physics student of Ernest Rutherford at Cambridge, and while teaching in Liverpool had met and married Hilda Reavley, the daughter of an Anglican clergyman. At the age of six Juliet suffered from tuberculosis; with her father away working in the US on the Manhattan Project and her mother suffering from depression after the birth of her younger brother, Jonathan, as well as shell-shock from the London blitz, Juliet was sent away to relatives in the north of England. After the war she was fostered in the warmer climate of the Bahamas and then, after her father became rector of Canterbury University College at the University of New Zealand (now the University of Canterbury), she was placed in boarding school on New Zealand’s North Island before finally rejoining her parents in 1948. Her friendship with Pauline Parker began at Christchurch girls’ high school; they were bonded by ill-health, as Pauline had suffered from osteomyelitis as a young girl and both were exempt from PE classes. Though from markedly different social backgrounds they created their own intense fantasy world in a friendship that Perry later characterised as “obsessive”. When Juliet’s mother, by then a marriage counsellor, was found by her father in bed with a client, Walter Perry, her father sued for divorce and was awarded custody of the children. However, Juliet was then told that she would be taken to live with relatives in South Africa, rather than returning to Britain with her father and brother. Pauline convinced herself that if her own mother died, then she would be allowed to travel to live with Juliet in South Africa, and so the girls arranged to attack Honorah while they were walking in Victoria Park in Christchurch; they used a brick, hitting her dozens of times until she died. As soon as Juliet was indicted, her father left New Zealand with her brother, while her mother remained, selling her possessions to pay for Juliet’s defence. The girls’ sentences forbade them ever to have contact with each other. When Juliet entered Mount Eden prison in Auckland, her mother and Walter Perry moved to Britain and eventually married, settling in Northumberland, far from her father, who was by then heading the British hydrogen bomb project at Aldermaston. After her release, Juliet renamed herself Anne Perry. She worked as an air stewardess and then a department store buyer in Newcastle upon Tyne, and for five years in Los Angeles as a property underwriter. She converted to Mormonism before joining her mother and stepfather in Northumberland. In her childhood diaries she had dreamed of being a writer; after six years of rejection her first novel, The Cater Street Hangman, was published in 1979. Her books were invariably concerned with issues of social injustice, drawing to some extent on the experiences that led up to her own imprisonment. “As a minor I wasn’t allowed to speak, and I heard all those lies being told,” she said. “Nobody bothered to talk to me.” Detectives in her novels often give voice to those who are otherwise ignored. Although she admitted her guilt, she felt wronged by what had happened to her as a teenager, including allegations in court of a lesbian affair with Parker, which she always denied. She rejected most requests for interviews, saying in 2002 that “I have no interest in gazing on other people’s misery.” Perry moved to Los Angeles in 2017 to help sell her stories for television and films. She suffered a heart attack in 2022, from which she never recovered. Her last novel, a Daniel Pitt mystery, was published a week before her death. In a 2006 interview with the Glasgow Herald, she asked: “Do you think the day will ever come when I am judged for my work alone? Will I ever be judged for what I am and not for what I was?” She is survived by her brother, who had occasionally acted as her researcher. • Anne Perry (Juliet Marion Hulme), novelist, born 28 October 1938; died 10 April 2023",

    "author": "N/A",
    "content": "Re Larry Elliott’s article ( A property tax based on annually uprated values would be a gamechanger, 9 April ), a proportional property tax (PPT) is indeed fairer than council tax. In particular, it reverses the bizarre taxing of occupants rather than owners. But it wastes an opportunity to improve the whole UK property tax system. According to the Office for National Statistics, land value represents 60% of the UK’s wealth , and 70% of the land is owned by 1% of the population . Concentrated land ownership is the driver of the UK’s gross wealth inequality and housing misery for so many. Why should vast country estates and farms be inherited tax-free or bought by billionaires? No one made land – it is our common wealth, and a land value tax (LVT) is how it can be fairly shared. The Fairer Share campaign has suggested a £100-a-month maximum increase above council tax as part of its PPT proposal . It would be more progressive to instead set an LVT rate equivalent to the current lowest council tax rate ( Westminster’s ) and increase that as “levelling up” progresses. For a revenue-neutral outcome, rates could be set initially by each local authority to obtain the same income as council tax. LVT should replace all UK property taxes, not just council tax and stamp duty. Carol Wilcox Secretary, Labour Land Campaign • Larry Elliott rails against the unfairness of council tax, but proposes a solution with even more unfairness. The purpose of council tax is to pay for council services, which have little or nothing to do with the value of your house or the land it sits on. I have my roots in London going back generations, and have been forced to move out due to property prices, ending up unwittingly in an equally expensive area, and having paid handsomely through large mortgages for a modest house, while friends in other counties live in huge properties for which they paid relatively little. I am indifferent to the value of my house as it does not benefit me at all while I am alive – a proper inheritance tax (IHT) would deal with that issue – so I rather resent the suggestion that I should pay a large tax on its unearned and unwanted value to pay for increasingly third-rate council services, while those in larger properties elsewhere with a greater call on services are asked to pay less. Jeremy Scroxton Thames Ditton, Surrey • If a proportional property tax based on the value of housing was introduced, a rough calculation shows that the amount that we pay here in Ickenham would rise by 60% to 70%. Householders in Bolton with a house valued at £150,000 would pay about 73% less. Council tax is raised to pay for local amenities – garbage collection, street repairs, libraries etc. I assume that these costs are similar wherever you live in the country. My local authority would see a huge rise in revenue by at least 60%, whereas in Bolton they would now be looking at revenue reduced to around 25% of what it was. How to make up this shortfall? Presumably those in favour of a PPT would argue that the winning local authorities should subsidise the losing ones. How does this affect us if we cannot afford to pay the extra tax? Larry Elliott suggests downsizing. If we did that, when we moved from our beloved home to a tiny flat, we would still be paying three times as much tax as the Bolton resident. How is that fair?

    "content": "Aditya Chakrabortty makes many valid points, but does not mention right to buy, a policy introduced by Margaret Thatcher in 1980 to break up council estates ( Disappearing schools, families forced out – and we call this progress, 13 April ). Since 1850, philanthropic organisations and councils have built decent housing close to the centre of London for people who work in the low-paid jobs that keep the metropolis functioning – cleaning and caring, maintaining essential services, driving buses and trains, delivering post etc. They replaced Victorian slums, housed first world war heroes, repopulated second world war bomb sites and met the needs of London’s homeless people. Encouraging tenants to buy these precious assets at a huge discount was, and remains, popular – but at a terrible cost to London’s communities. Local authorities have not been allowed to use the receipts to replace their lost stock, and far too little public or private housing has been built in recent decades to meet the needs of any of London’s young families. About 40% of the houses and flats on London estates that were bought under right to buy are now privately rented (not to families in the greatest housing need), and larger houses built by councils to accommodate big families have been converted into bedsits, let individually at excessive rents to single people. New central developments are for the wealthy (assuming they are lived in at all) and local councils come under relentless pressure to reduce their requirements for small quotas of “affordable” housing in new private developments. Ending the right to buy, and building new housing for ordinary Londoners, must now be our top political priorities.

    "author": "N/A",
    "content": "Your support for a “visitor tax” ( Editorial, 10 April ) glosses over the realities of the cost of living crisis and the continuing impact of the pandemic. It fails to recognise that not all visitors are equal. There is a vast difference in disposable income between a family holidaying in a caravan, a single person in well-paid work heading off for a weekend, or someone staying in a hostel. Hostels were closed and restricted for longer than other establishments during the pandemic. Those losses will never be recouped. Higher energy costs make opening during the colder months challenging or unviable, and charges have increased. Those with money tend not to share dormitories with strangers, paying barely more than £15-£30 a night. Related: Welsh government to press ahead with visitor levy plan In Wales, the government plans to introduce legislation allowing local authorities to set a visitor tax, but has conveniently ignored its own evidence. A Visit Wales market demand report this year found that, compared with 2022, non-Welsh visitors in 2023 are more likely to say they “can’t afford a trip to Wales” and that they are “taking an overseas holiday instead”. Its Wales tourism business barometer 2023 report found that “on balance, the industry has still not recovered to pre-pandemic levels”. Not all local authorities need more money. Gwynedd council in north Wales has usable reserves of nearly £143m. It could invest in any required infrastructure for tourists. A visitor tax is regressive and will make it harder for those on low incomes to afford a holiday. Jill Hughes and Neil Martinson Snowdonia Mountain Hostel, Nant Ffrancon, Gwynedd • This letter was amended on 19 April 2023. An earlier version said the Welsh government had passed legislation allowing local authorities to set a visitor tax.",

    "author": "Richard Luscombe",
    "content": "A heartbroken four-year-old girl’s lost teddy bear, containing a recording of her late mother’s heartbeat, has sparked a desperate search in Tennessee after it was mistakenly donated to a thrift shop. The tie-dyed bear was dropped off by the girl’s father among other donations at the Goodwill Industries store in New Tazewell about 50 miles (80km) north-west of Knoxville, company officials say, and was quickly sold. Related: Virginia fifth-grader’s textbook correction gets hat tip from publisher “The father came back to see if it was still there after he realized his mistake, but it was already gone,” said the communications director for Goodwill Industries Knoxville , Cindy Dodson, whose organization operates 28 stores in the state. “Unfortunately our staff don’t know if something is donated by mistake or has sentimental value,” Dodson said. “We’re doing our best to get the word out that this little girl would like her teddy bear back, and we’re hopeful that she will.” The audio recording of the heartbeat is the only thing the girl had to remind her of her mother, according to the local television news station WATE , which says it spoke to the girl’s father. “My daughter’s mom passed away and her grandma made her [the] bear with her mom’s heartbeat in it,” Tylor Kennedy, the father, told the station. Goodwill has posted notices in its network of stores and on its social media channels. The Big One, a local radio station, is also appealing to its listeners in Tennessee, Kentucky and Virginia for word of the bear’s whereabouts. The station posted an update to Facebook on Monday containing what it said was a video of the bear with the heartbeat recording provided by the girl’s grandmother. “The bear is still most likely in the tri-state area,” it said. Dodson said she was certain that whoever had bought the bear would be happy to reunite it with its real owner. “The community where the store is, it’s very tight, very friendly, and I’m sure the word is getting out,” Dodson said. “But this is a rural area where not everyone has access to computers or social media, so we appreciate everyone’s help in letting folks know that this little girl is missing her very special teddy bear.”",

    "title": "Ukraine criticises Brazil’s peace efforts and invites Lula to see invasion’s effects ",
    "author": "Constance Malleret in Rio de Janeiro",
    "content": "Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has condemned the “violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity” by Russia and again called for mediation to end the war, as he came under fire for his previous comments on the conflict. Speaking at a lunch on Tuesday with Romanian president Klaus Iohannis, Lula said a group of neutral nations must come together to help broker peace between Russia and Ukraine. Lula faced criticism from the US over comments he made over the weekend that they were prolonging the fighting by supplying arms to Ukraine. Earlier on Tuesday, Ukraine’s government also criticised Lula for his efforts to broker a peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow, and invited the Brazilian leader to visit the war-torn country and see for himself the consequences of the Russian invasion. On Monday Russia’s minister of foreign affairs, Sergei Lavrov, visited Brasília, and praised Lula’s calls for a negotiated settlement. Related: Lavrov’s Brazil visit highlights Lula’s neutral foreign policy despite US dismay A spokesperson for Ukraine’s foreign ministry said on Tuesday that Kyiv was watching Lula’s efforts to resolve the conflict “with interest” but criticised the Brazilian government for giving equal weight to “the victim and the aggressor”. The spokesperson, Oleg Nikolenko, confirmed that Lula had been invited to visit Kyiv “to understand the real causes of Russian aggression and its consequences for global security”. Lula has refused to supply weapons to Ukraine and suggested that Brazil could lead a “peace club” of neutral countries to mediate discussions between the two sides, as part of his efforts to return the South American country to international relevance after the isolation of the Jair Bolsonaro years. A non-aligned approach is coherent with Brazil’s longstanding foreign policy tradition of peace and cooperation. But the west increasingly views Brazil’s neutrality in the war as skewed towards Russia. “If you want to be taken seriously as a peace broker in this conflict, you need to visit both sides. Not only Russia,” said Bruna Santos, director of the Brazil Institute at the Wilson Center thinktank. In Washington, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters US officials have privately made clear the Biden administration’s displeasure to Brazilian counterparts about Lula’s criticism of the arming of Ukraine. Lula’s foreign policy adviser Celso Amorim called the US criticism “absurd” and insisted Brazil did not share Russia’s position. Last month Amorim met Vladimir Putin in Moscow to discuss prospects for peace and organise Lavrov’s visit to Brasília. Speaking on Monday alongside his Brazilian counterpart, Mauro Vieira, Lavrov praised Brazil’s efforts for peace talks and expressed gratitude for its “understanding of the genesis of the situation”. There have been no such bilateral encounters with Ukrainian officials and Washington rebuked Lula for hosting Lavrov. The US national security council spokesperson, John Kirby, accused Brazil on Monday of “parroting Russian and Chinese propaganda without at all looking at the facts”. Lula had ruffled feathers with comments over the weekend suggesting both sides were responsible for the conflict, and that the US and the European Union were not committed to pursuing peace. “Europe and the US end up contributing to the continuation of this war,” Lula said from Abu Dhabi on Sunday, having said a day earlier in Beijing that the US must “stop encouraging the war”. Lula’s state visit to China last week, part of his diplomatic reset , will have further irked officials in Washington in light of growing international tensions. Brazil’s foreign minister Vieira rejected the White House’s criticism. “I don’t agree at all,” he told journalists. But after the rebukes from Kyiv and Washington, Lula on Tuesday adopted a more critical tone of the Russian invasion. “At the same time that my government condemns the violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, we defend a negotiated political solution,” he said, after meeting with President Klaus Iohannis of Romania.",

    "content": "Former NFL defensive end Chris Smith has died at the age of 31, according to his agent, Drew Rosenhaus. “Rest in Peace Chris,” Rosenhaus wrote on Twitter. “Condolences to all his family, friends and loved ones. We will miss you.” A cause of death has not been released. Smith played college football at Arkansas before being selected by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the fifth-round of the 2014 draft. He also had spells with the Cincinnati Bengals, Las Vegas Raiders, Cleveland Browns, Carolina Panthers and Baltimore Ravens. He last played in the NFL for the Houston Texans in 2021, but had signed for the XFL’s Seattle Sea Dragons in March. Several NFL players paid tribute to Smith on Tuesday. “Rest in paradise Chris Smith,” wrote Cleveland Browns tight end David Njoku on Twitter. “Hometown hero and a brother to everyone. Such a kind soul. This is Heartbreaking.” Former Raiders quarterback Derek Carr shared a photo of the two together with the message: “Love you bro.” Smith had endured tragedy in his personal life. In 2019 his girlfriend, Petara Cordero, was killed after being struck by a car . The two had recently had a daughter together.",

    "title": "Campaigners urge action over carbon footprint of disposable nappies",
    "author": "James Hockaday",
    "content": "Environmental campaigners are calling on the UK government to take action after new analysis found a significant difference between the carbon footprints of washable and disposable nappies. Reusable nappies have 25% less global heating potential compared with single-use nappies , according to a report commissioned by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). The environmental impact of production was shown to be nearly nine times greater for single-use nappies, and nearly 10 times greater when it came to their disposal. However, the report paints a mixed picture, with reusable nappies given a worse impact score for 11 of 18 categories – mainly associated with water and electricity usage when washing and drying. Related: Reuse? Compost? Dump? Solving the eco-conundrum of nappies Disposable nappies are one of the biggest single contributors to plastic waste worldwide, but a 2005 life cycle analysis declared there was “little or no difference between the environmental impact of reusable and disposable nappies”. This resulted in a lack of action from policymakers, according to campaigners, who say the government has a responsibility to make it easier for parents to switch to reusables. “We’ve seen the British government be really bold on lots of stuff to do with single-use plastic,” said Elisabeth Whitebread of the Nappy Alliance campaign group. “We’ve had the first plastic packaging tax in the world, we’ve recently seen them banning single-use plastic cutlery and plates , but by the number of items, as well as the weight and volume, nappies represent a much greater contribution to single-use plastic waste. “This clearly needs policy initiative but also awareness raising – so many people don’t even think about nappies as a single-use plastic.” Hilary Vick, a founder of the washable nappy service Nappy Ever After, added: “The playing field is unequal because parents and carers have the task and the expense of washing nappies and the time it takes, and yet the disposal of nappies is free. They’re readily available in supermarkets, which makes it seem normal – governments and local authorities have a responsibility to go against those norms.” While Defra’s report could be a significant step forward for the reusable industry, single-use nappies were only found to leave a worse impact in seven of the categories, including global heating potential, land use, fossil resource scarcity and water use in manufacturing. But campaigners say these effects are particularly critical in light of the climate crisis. Reusable nappies scored worse in areas including marine eutrophication, freshwater ecotoxicity, mineral resource scarcity, marine ecotoxicity and water consumption. The main factors behind their effects are water, detergent and electricity use when washing and drying nappies, and flushing faeces. The report says parents can lessen their impact by using energy-efficient washing machines, air drying instead of tumble drying and passing nappies to a second child. The Absorbent Hygiene Product Manufacturers Association (AHPMA) pointed to a 28% reduction in the global heating potential of disposables since 2005, as improved technology had led to smaller nappies and fewer materials being used in production – the reduction for reusables was 38.5% The industry body suggested the difference in CO 2 impact set out in the latest report was not as great as it might appear at first glance. It pointed to the report’s comparison of 2.5 years in disposable nappies to 6.4 return car journeys from London to Nottingham (1,622 miles), compared with 4.8 journeys (1,223 miles) for reusables – amounting to a difference of 400 miles. “This should reassure parents and carers that both options represent responsible choices for babies, as they also consider performance, skin health benefits, and convenience when deciding on the best nappy option based on their individual family needs and lifestyles,” the AHPMA added. A Defra spokesperson said: “We are committed to maximising resources and minimising waste, and are reviewing the findings of this analysis.”",

    "title": "Exam marking boycott by UK university staff could delay graduations this summer",
    "author": "Richard Adams Education editor",
    "content": "Students face potential delays in their degree results and graduations this summer after the University and College Union said it would go ahead with industrial action over pay that could result in exams and essays being left unmarked. While UCU members called a halt to the union’s long-running dispute over pensions, after 85% voted to accept a deal to improve retirement benefits, they also voted to reject an offer on pay and working conditions, triggering the marking boycott starting on Thursday. Jo Grady, the UCU’s general secretary, said employers needed to return to negotiations to avoid delays caused by the assessment boycott by members working at 145 UK universities. “University staff have been clear that they want a better deal, and it is in the interests of employers to make an enhanced offer and prevent serious disruption hitting graduations,” Grady said. Related: Work-life balance as important as pay, says university staff union The rejected proposal would have committed employers to a consultation on ending the use of zero-hours contracts, as well as further negotiations on other forms of casual contracts, closing equality pay gaps and reducing workloads. The deal included an earlier pay increase of between 5% and 8% made earlier this year. The boycott means that exam results or coursework marks could be delayed, leaving some students unable to graduate before the end of the academic year unless institutions opt to award degrees using previous marks. The UCU will hold a special meeting of its higher education branch this week to consider further steps over pay, which may include strike action. Last month UCU members were on strike for six days, and voted to renew the union’s strike mandate for a further six months. Raj Jethwa, chief executive of the Universities and Colleges Employers Association, said the rejection of the pay offer was “disappointing but not surprising” after UCU advised members to vote against acceptance. Jethwa suggested that the union’s membership was split over the deal, with only a third of its members voting in consultative ballot to reject the offer, despite employers taking part in talks with UCU on working conditions through the Acas conciliation service. “Although two-thirds of academics are not actually members of UCU or any union, any threat to hurt students by not assessing their work through the marking and assessment boycott is taken extremely seriously. Despite consistent feedback from higher education institutions confirming low and isolated industrial action impacts, institutions will again prioritise mitigations to support students,” Jethwa said. Grady hailed the end of the pensions dispute as a life-changing victory for the union. “When we launched our pensions dispute, university vice-chancellors doubted us, and government ministers criticised us,” Grady said. “We were told it was impossible to win back a stolen pension, but today UCU members have proven that it can be done, and we have taken a giant step towards a historic victory that will change lives.”. The pensions deal aims to overturn substantial cuts in retirement income imposed through the universities superannuation scheme last year, which UCU claimed would reduce average benefits by 35%. • This article was amended on 20 April 2023. An earlier version said that UCU members rejected a proposal on ending the use of zero-hours contracts and other forms of casual contracts; this should have made clear it was a consultation on this issue that was voted against. Also, UCU members were on strike for six days in March, not three.",

That’s its joint-best run since December 2020, when it also rose for eight days in a row. Mining stocks were lifted by China’s forecast-beating growth of 4.5% in the first quarter of this year, while gambling company Entain gained 7.2% after reporting a rise in gaming revenue this morning. Hopes that the UK economy might avoid recession this year have also boosted markets in recent weeks, while the panic in the US and European banking sector has eased. 4.26pm BST Following this morning’s rise in unemployment, and higher-than-expected pay growth, City investors are now bracing for the latest inflation data. Economists predict that Britain’s annual inflation rate could fall below 10% for the first time since last August when the latest official figures for the cost of living are released at 7am on Wednesday (see you there!). Our economics editor Larry Elliott reports: A sharp fall in energy prices is thought likely to have dragged down the government’s preferred measure of inflation from 10.4% in February to 9.8% in March, according to a poll of economists conducted by Reuters. The Bank of England , which is responsible for hitting the official 2% inflation target, believes there will be further falls over the coming months as the impact fades of last year’s invasion of Ukraine by Russia. The consumer prices index rose by 1.1% in March alone last year, followed by a further 2.5% increase in April, but the price of gas on global wholesale markets is now lower than it was before the war began on 24 February 2022. Related: UK inflation expected to dip below 10% as energy prices fall 4.22pm BST We’ve seen a flurry of takeover approaches in recent days , and a dearth of companies coming onto the stock market to replace them. My colleague Nils Pratley has a solution: create a regulated platform that would allow private companies to operate share-trading windows – perhaps once a week or once a month – as a stepping stone towards the public arena. That could cut the number of start-ups who cash out through a sale to private equity, rather than floating…. As Nils explains: The aim is to lessen the perceived cliff edge between private ownership and quoted life. A company would get access to a bit of public market liquidity without the full-blown reporting demands of a proper IPO. Early-stage backers would be able to cash in a few chips, which might dampen their lobbying for an all-or-nothing outcome in which a trade sale too often beats an IPO. Big UK institutional investors would be able to test the waters, get familiar with a company and maybe, over time, exert influence in favour of the stock market. The proposal is clearly not a cure-all (reforming the regulatory rulebook in areas where London’s setup just looks more cumbersome than other venues is probably more important). Nor is it likely to happen soon, since stock exchange officials are clear that some serious rewriting of rules would be necessary, not least to ensure equality of information between all investors while still preserving the looser touch of private life. Nor, obviously, would all companies on such a new platform convert to the full market. But, after a taster experience, some might. At the very least, it is a genuinely novel idea since it isn’t being done elsewhere. If the London Stock Exchange wants to be “young and scrappy” to compete, as newish boss Julia Hoggett has argued , this is the sort of thing it should be trying. The dominance of private equity has gone too far. Related: Private equity’s dominance has gone too far | Nils Pratley 4.10pm BST India and Russia have entered “advanced negotiations” over a free trade agreement that aims to build closer economic ties as most western governments push to isolate Moscow over the war in Ukraine . In a development likely to add to tensions in Washington, London and EU capitals, Russia and India’s trade ministers said on Monday the two countries were in talks to strike a free trade deal. Speaking on a visit to Delhi, the Russian deputy prime minister Denis Manturov, who is also the trade minister, said: “Together with the Eurasian Economic Commission, we are looking forward to intensifying negotiations on a free trade agreement with India.” More here . 3.59pm BST Online UK retail tech company THG said its annual losses widened last year to £550m amid higher costs and as home shopping waned with the end of pandemic lockdowns. Shares in the troubled group dived 17% on Tuesday as it revealed that pretax losses had almost tripled in the year to 31 March while sales had risen just 2.7% to £2.2bn. THG, formerly known as The Hut Group, said it had faced higher prices for vital commodities including whey, a product in its sports nutrition business. It had also taken on one-off costs from cutting 2,000 jobs at ditched divisions including the specialist cycling site ProBikeKit. The group has written down the value of assets to reflect “more challenging global markets”.

J&J reported a net loss of $68m for the first quarter of this year, down from a profit of $5.15bn in Q1 2022. Earnings were pulled down by a $6.9bn litigation expense. Earnings per share fell by 101.6% to -$0.03 in Q1, from $1.93/share a year earlier, due to this charge. J&J also reported a gross profit of $16.35bn on $24.75bn of sales.

BofA benefited from higher interest rates and solid loan growth, but did also set aside $931m to cover potential credit losses. 2.37pm BST On Wall Street, shares in Goldman Sachs have dropped 3% at the open after it reported a drop in earnings . Net profits at Goldman Sachs fell 18% in the first quarter of this year, to $3.23bn. It also missed analysts’ expectations for revenue, after taking a $470m hit related to the sale of loans from its consumer unit, Marcus. David Solomon , Goldman’s chairman and chief executive officer, says it was an eventful quarter. The events of the first quarter acted as another real-life stress test, demonstrating the resilience of Goldman Sachs and the nation’s largest financial institutions. But Goldman did suffer from a slowdown in dealmaking, which led to lower net revenues at its Global Banking & Markets arm. The company says: Investment banking fees were $1.58 billion, 26% lower than the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to significantly lower net revenues in Advisory, reflecting a significant decline in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions transactions, and Debt underwriting, reflecting a decline in industry-wide volumes. Updated at 2.41pm BST 2.25pm BST EasyJet boss says travel sector better prepared this summer The boss of easyJet has said the travel industry is much better prepared for this summer than last year, when staff shortages led to chaos at airports – but passengers are likely to pay significantly more to get away. The budget airline lifted its profit outlook for this year after summer bookings rose and passenger numbers over Easter returned to pre-pandemic levels. Fares have risen sharply, although Johan Lundgren, the easyJet chief executive, defended the increase as being largely driven by fuel and comparable to wider cost-of-living rises in supermarkets. Revenue per seat, which is mainly fares, rose by 31% in the last quarter and is expected to be 20% higher than 2022 until the end of June, although it “remains to be seen” where demand would push fares in summer. Lundgren said the £12 average increase in the last few months was “a couple of coffees and a snack in an airport”. He said the airline had completed its largest ever crew recruitment drive, after hiring around 3,000 people in the last year. He said: “We are fully recruited in terms of cabin crew and pilots but of course the difficulty is that you will see weaknesses across the industry in other parts of the chain – but everybody is significantly better prepared than they were at this point last year\".” More here : Related: EasyJet boss says travel sector better prepared this summer but fares higher 1.50pm BST The US housing sector cooled last month, new official data shows.

The news comes after Sky News reported that Liontrust was among a number of parties which have been actively considering a bid for GAM. GAM’s share price has jumped 15% today, to 0.69 Swiss francs, but is down 95% over the last five years. GAM has been engulfed in turmoil linked to the collapse of Greensill Capital, the controversial supply chain finance group advised by former PM David Cameron. In 2018 GAM surprisingly fired its former top fund manager, Tim Haywood. Haywood, a star performer at GAM, had invested in bonds issued by Greensill. The UK’s FCA later fined GAM and Haywood, £9.1m and £230,000 respectively, over failings including not reporting a dinner at Buckingham Palace, a £15,000 private jet trip to Sardinia, or secret fees and share options offered to his company by Greensill.

The Treasury has announced that Haldane , productivity and growth expert Dr Anna Valero and Sir Jonathan Symonds , the chair of pharmaceuticals firm GSK, are joining Hunt’s Economic Advisory Council. The Council was announced last October, when Hunt was trying to rebuild confidence in the government after the mini-budget shambles. It already includes Rupert Harrison , a former advisor to George Osborne, Karen Ward of JP Morgan Asset Management, and former Bank of England policymakers Sushil Wadhwani and Gertjan Vlieghe Today, Hunt says: “I am delighted to announce three new members of the Economic Advisory Council who collectively have decades of economic experience across the private and public sector. “Economic growth is essential to our long-term prospects and in the face of global headwinds, this council plays a critical role in helping our economy meet these challenges.” Related: Who are the economic experts appointed to Jeremy Hunt’s new advisory panel? Haldane left the BoE in the summer of 2021, with a prescient warning that the ‘beast of inflation’ was prowling in the UK economy. Related: Mr Boom quits the Bank of England warning about the ‘beast of inflation’ During his time at the Bank, he rattled out some rather decent speeches. This included comparing curbing financial crises to a dog chasing a frisbee (the trick, apparently, is to peg along at a speed where the angle of gaze to the frisbee remains roughly constant), and explaining monetary policy in the context of cricket shots (playing off the back foot works best when there are reasons to be fearful). And last summer, Haldane warned that Britain’s serious economic problems won’t be solved by massive tax cuts, telling The Guardian: “The solution to the growth conundrum and the solution to the cost of living crisis both lie squarely on the supply side of the economy.” Related: Andy Haldane: we can fix the cost of living crisis.

EUROPE'S STOXX 600 HITS FRESH 14-MONTH HIGH, LAST UP 0.51% — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) April 18, 2023 The pan-European Stoxx 600 has gained 0.5%, lifted by the stronger-than-forecast Chinese growth data this morning. It’s trading at 469.32, a 14-month high. Investors are hopeful that China’s recovery is on track, after GDP rose by a better-than-expected 4.5% per year in Q1, as we learned overnight . Raffi Boyadjian , lead investment analyst at XM , says: The economic recovery in China appears to be gaining tract as GDP expanded by a stronger-than-expected 4.5% in the first quarter of 2023, beating forecasts of 4.0%. At a quarterly level, growth quickened to 2.2% from an upwardly revised 0.6% in the prior period. However, the upbeat data didn’t offer everything the markets wanted to hear as the reopening rebound was led mainly by consumers and private investment remained weak, raising question marks about the sustainability of the recovery. Property investment was one of the soft spots as, despite a pickup in sales, new developments slumped in the three months to March. Updated at 12.18pm BST 11.28am BST Recent turmoil in the banking sector could push UK insolvencies higher this year, according to David Kelly, Head of Insolvency at PwC. Kelly explains: “ While there was some good news earlier this month that the UK avoided a technical recession, this has been of little comfort to businesses, many of whom are still struggling with adverse economic conditions. As a result, there has been a sharp uptick in insolvencies in March, with 2,457 the highest we’ve seen this year so far and the highest they have been for 4 years. “ Businesses are struggling to secure financing and pay off their loans due to high interest rates and the wider impact inflation and consumer sentiment is having on sales and cash flows, so company insolvencies will likely continue to rise in the short term, making for a challenging spring. This is particularly the case following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which has caused lenders to reassess risk appetites . However, hard hit sectors like hospitality and leisure might soon begin to reap the benefits of the weather improving , so we hope to see the number of insolvencies in these sectors dip during the summer months, which will be a relief to pubs, restaurants and hotels who have struggled through the start of the year. 11.25am BST Corporate insolvencies rose to their highest level for more than three years in March, according to new figures from @insolvencygovuk . Personal #insolvency levels also reached a 12-month high. You can read our statement here: https://t.co/wBVmOPNqGk — R3 Press Office (@R3PressOffice) April 18, 2023 11.14am BST Insolvencies are now spreading to larger corporates in England and Wales, warns Inga West , counsel at law firm Ashurst. West says there is an uptick in companies falling into insolvency, across economic sectors: “In contrast with recent months, March 2023’s higher corporate insolvency stats apply to all three categories of insolvency process: creditor voluntary liquidations and compulsory liquidations and others (which includes administrations and company voluntary arrangements). Before now, the increased business failure rate had been concentrated at the SME end of the market (CVLs and compulsory liquidations). But the rise in administrations and company voluntary liquidations indicates that insolvencies are now spreading to larger corporates. And this correlates with what Ashurst is seeing - a definite uptick in the number of administrations compared to previous months and recent years spread across a range of sectors. While the IMF and the British government quarrel over whether the UK is going to go into a recession this year, and the Bank of England ponders whether SVB and Credit Suisse were a blip or part of a bigger problem, companies in England and Wales are clearly finding it hard. Higher insolvency rates can also lead to a bigger insolvency domino effect, where creditors of insolvent businesses don’t get paid and go bust themselves. On the plus side, so much about doing business in the UK is unpredictable at the moment. This recent high corporate insolvency rate might not be sustained.” 10.58am BST March’s increase in insolvencies across England and Wales comes at a time of significant uncertainties in the UK and global economy, points out Jeremy Whiteson, restructuring and insolvency partner at city law firm, Fladgate . Whiteson adds: The recent difficulties with SVB bank have added to the growing list of risk factors- including shortage of staff, high inflation, geo-political strife, and continuing changes of regulation on imports and exports to Europe. It would be unsurprising if the number of corporate insolvencies continued to be high over coming months. 10.47am BST MHA: perfect storm drives up company insolvencies The withdrawal of government support for companies is pushing insolvencies higher in England and Wales , warns Nick O’Reilly , director of restructuring and recovery at accountancy firm MHA: O’Reilly fears administrations will to continue to climb this year as businesses face a very challenging environment with “meagre” government support: He says: “After recent warnings, UK business administrations have now risen to pre-pandemic levels. As businesses continue to face a perfect storm of high energy bills, increasing interest rates and detrimental inflation, alongside little to no government support, we should expect administrations to continue to rise in the months ahead. “The government should want to avoid administrations increasing in the short term because of the impact this could have on markets and business confidence. However, given how underwhelming the Chancellor’s spring budget was in terms of business support, we have to conclude it’s a sad reality that high insolvency numbers are acceptable for the government who want to clear out the zombie companies and allow the fittest to survive.” “Fortunately, there are a lot of vacancies in the labour market which will limit the impact of job losses, keeping unemployment down and preventing a spike in demand for welfare payments.” Updated at 10.55am BST 10.41am BST Christina Fitzgerald , President of R3 , the insolvency and restructuring trade body, points out that corporate insolvencies increased by 37.7% in March, to a total of 2,457 , compared to February’s total of 1,784. Fitzgerald says some businesses are choosing to shut down due to turbulent trading, and high energy costs. “The rise in corporate insolvencies – to the highest levels for more than three years – has been driven by increasing numbers of Creditors’ Voluntary Liquidations, which are also at a three-year high. “Business owners have spent three years trading through a pandemic and economic uncertainty, and an increasing number are choosing to shut their businesses before that choice is taken away from them and as the turbulent trading climate proves too much. “Businesses across Britain are struggling at the moment. Costs continue to rise at a time when consumers are cutting back on discretionary spending, and when staff are requesting pay rises to cover their bills. With the Government’s Energy Bill Relief Scheme ending at the end of March, many businesses will be facing further increases in costs at a time when they can ill-afford them, Fitzgerald adds: “Directors need to be vigilant about the signs of financial distress and seek advice as soon as they spot issues with their business or begin to worry about its finances. “If stock is starting to pile up, cashflow is an issue, or the business is having problems paying rent, staff or suppliers, now is the time to seek advice, rather than further down the line when these issues have evolved into problems. 10.18am BST Insolvencies jump 16% in England and Wales The number of firms collapsing into insolvency across England and Wales jumped last month, as companies were hit by economic headwinds such as soaring costs and weak consumer spending . There were 2,457 company insolvencies in March, government data shows, which is a 16% increase on the same month a year ago. Compulsory liquidations more than doubled, to 288. The Insolvency Service explains: Numbers of compulsory liquidations have increased from historical lows seen during the coronavirus pandemic, partly as a result of an increase in winding-up petitions presented by HMRC. There was also a 9% increase in Creditors’ Voluntary Liquidations (CVLs), to 2,011, in which directors decide to put their company into liquidation because it is insolvent. Experts say this jump in insolvencies shows the economic pressures facing UK companies. Gareth Harris, partner at RSM UK Restructuring Advisory, explains: ‘It is clear from these latest numbers and our increasing workloads that while we may not be in a technical recession, the economic headwinds are continuing to bite. Although some confidence is returning in the wider economy those companies that are struggling are clearly seeing less options available to them than in the last four years. The majority of the current insolvency figures remain “shut-down” style liquidations of smaller companies which we expect to peak soon before falling in the second half of the year. David Hudson, restructuring advisory partner at FRP , warns that high energy bills could force more companies to close down: “More and more firms are at risk of tipping from ‘danger’ to ‘distress’. And with trading conditions still punishing, we can anticipate higher than-usual levels of insolvency for some time to come. “Energy is one factor that will continue to pose a significant threat to businesses’ stability. While wholesale prices have been falling, the new government support scheme provides businesses with less protection from future volatility. As just one example of the impact this could have, as many as a fifth of retailers we recently polled were not confident in trading through the next year with this degree of reduced support. “Additionally, nearly all Covid-19-era support measures have now closed to businesses, with many now having to service repayments on Covid support debt – only adding to the pressures they face.” 10.13am BST German investor sentiment has unexpectedly fallen this month. The ZEW economic research institute says its economic sentiment index decreased to 4.1 in April, from 13.0 in March. Economists polled by Reuters had expected an increase, to 15.3. Germany April ZEW: - Index 4.1 (est 15.6, last 13.0) - Actual Situation -32.5 (est -40.0, last -46.5) - Expectations 6.4 (last 10.0) I don't put too much attention to ZEW, as index is very volatile.

The Office for National Statistics said annual growth in average pay, excluding bonuses, held steady at 6.6% in the three months to February despite a small rise in unemployment and decline in the number of job vacancies. Fuelled by bumper pay for bankers and accountants in the City of London, wage growth including bonuses rose by 5.9%. Economists had forecast weaker rates of pay growth, in a potential dilemma for the Bank of England as it considers whether to raise interest rates for a 12th consecutive time in May. However, the ONS said total pay fell by 4.1% on the year after taking inflation into account – among the largest falls since 2009. Reflecting softer conditions in the jobs market as Britain’s economy struggles for growth momentum, the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 3.8%. The number of job vacancies also fell for a ninth consecutive month, although remained high at more than 1.1m as companies struggle to recruit staff. The chancellor Jeremy Hunt said: “While unemployment remains close to historic lows, rising prices continue to eat into pay cheques which is why halving inflation this year is one of our top economic priorities.” More here .

The money markets now indicate there is an 82% chance that the Bank of England increases base rate to 4.5% next month, which would be a quarter-point increase. Yesterday, this was a 70% chance. Today’s data showing UK regular pay grew by a stronger-than-expected 6.6% in December-February puts more pressure on the BoE to tighten monetary policy again. Russ Mould , investment director at AJ Bell , explains: While China’s economic growth has accelerated, so too has UK wage growth which puts the Bank of England in a difficult situation. It muddies the water with regards to the situation with inflation and hopes that the central bank would have enough reasons to stop putting up interest rates. “The Bank might argue the situation is a watching brief, not firm evidence of a trend with wage growth, and so it needs more data points before making any big decisions. 9.13am BST Ofgem: unacceptable behaviour by energy suppliers must stop The head of Britain’s energy regulator has warned suppliers that their reputations are “on the line”, as it announces its new code of practice today. Jonathan Brearley , the chief executive of Ofgem , told Radio 4’s Today programme that energy companies need to “up their game” in the way they look after vulnerable customers. Ofgem , he says, doesn’t want to see repeats of the unacceptable behaviour that has surfaced in recent months – such as debt agents ignoring signs that customers were vulnerable when force-fitting meters. Related: Grant Shapps ‘sitting on hands’ amid prepayment meter scandal, says Labour Under Ofgem’s new code of conduct, energy companies need to make at least 10 attempts to communicate with a customer to understand their circumstances before fitting a pre-payment meter. They must also conduct a site welfare visit, Brearley says, alongside “tighter monitoring” including through body-worn video camera. Brearley also confirmed there will be an outright ban on installing pre-payment meters for customers over-85, and customers with serious health conditions, as we reported last night. Related: Energy firms to ban forced prepay meter installations in homes of over-85s And he warns that suppliers must do everything they can to understand a customer’s circumstances if they have fallen behind on their bills, including through a home visit. Brearley says he has a message for the suppliers themselves: Your reputation is on the line. “There has been deep concern raised about the practices that have been seen over the past few months and indeed going back into history. “And if you do not improve what you do, quite frankly, there will be further rules and regulations which will be against your commercial interest. On top of that Ofgem will have close monitoring of what’s happening, and that’s why it’s really critical we have the video camera evidence so we can see what people are doing and we can pull that in and have a look at it if we need to. “But, equally, we have smart meters installed so we can see that if you’ve installed a prepayment meter, particularly for that second group of customers who need that deep welfare check and they are consistently coming off the supply, then you have not done your job properly and we will respond to that.” 8.45am BST UK stocks open higher on China optimism Shares have opened higher in London, as investors welcome the news that China’s economy grew faster than forecast at the start of this year. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index is up 20 points, or 0.25%, at 7900 points. It’s on track for its eighth rise in a row, a run that not been seen since December 2020. Mining companies are leading the rally, with Fresnillo up 3%, and Antofagasta and Anglo American both gaining 1.9%. This morning’s Chinese GDP data, showing the economy expanded by 4.5% per year in Q1, is bolstering hopes that Beijing’s lifting of Covid-19 restrictions and stimulus efforts are paying off.

Susannah Streeter , head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown , explains: As consumer confidence has grown and production has got back on track, retail sales have jumped to a two year high and industrial output has picked up a pace not seen for 5 months. The numbers helped put a spring in the step of miners as trading got underway in London. However, this rosier health check of the Chinese economy won’t be enough to fully assuage investors’ concerns about the prospects for the global economy. To some extent this uplift in output will have been partly down to a clearing of pandemic backlog orders. There will be worries that if the US heads into recession, and other economies contract or stagnate, few international orders will be flying into Chinese factories, so weakness is still being detected ahead.” London's FTSE 100 extends rally into eighth day https://t.co/jewCLhVryT pic.twitter.com/uGZNMZHNSB — Reuters UK (@ReutersUK) April 18, 2023 Gambling firm Entain is also rallying, up 2.4% after reporting higher quarterly net gaming revenues on Tuesday.

It enjoyed a strong performance in retail with first quarter NGR up 14%. The betting and gaming giant said it achieved record levels of active customers in the first quarter up 19% year-on-year. Sports betting platform BetMGM had a successful quarter partly thanks to the Super Bowl. Entain said earlier in the year it plans to end financial support for BetMGM, its joint venture with MGM Resorts. The parent company of Ladbrokes and Coral is trading higher today but remains modestly lower year-to-date. An upbeat financial update with an improvement in online net gaming revenue has helped to extend optimism after Entain raised its profit outlook in February. 8.14am BST High inflation, and worker shortages, are holding the UK economy back, warns Matthew Percival , the CBI’s Director for People and Skills: “This data shows a worrying continuation of the main trends of recent months. A tight labour market means it is still difficult for firms to hire the people they need and high inflation means that the value of wages are falling. Both of these dynamics are acting as a drag on growth.” 8.13am BST Here’s ITV’s Joel Hills on the UK’s falling wages: Wage growth (6.6%) across the economy is still not keeping pace with price rises (10.4%) and is higher than Bank of England will feel comfortable with BUT the trend seems to be sloping downwards and the gap between the private and the public has narrowed significantly. pic.twitter.com/KdiNtqJt1n — Joel Hills (@ITVJoel) April 18, 2023 8.10am BST Faster UK wage growth is unwelcome news for the Bank of England Today’s jobs market report rather highlights the dilemma facing the Bank of England. On the one hand, rising unemployment is a reason to hold off raising interest rates again, when policymakers meet in May. But, the 6.6% rise in basic earnings will worry the BoE, which is already concerned about a wage-price spiral breaking out (although wages aren’t even keeping up with inflation). This faster UK wage growth is unwelcome news for the Bank of England, says James Smith, developed markets economist at ING. The surprise pick-up in UK wage growth casts doubt over recent indications that pay pressures have started to ease. We should caution that one month doesn’t make a trend, though a similar surprise blowout in services inflation due on Wednesday would inevitably move the dial in favour of a 25bp rate from the Bank of England next month. 2 steps forward, 2 steps back…Among employees in Dec 22 to Feb 23 - Growth in avg total pay (inc bonuses)=5.9% & in regular pay (exc bonuses)=6.6%.

Unemployment is lower too, but 422,000 more people are economically inactive (see chart below). Progress in repairing the UK’s labour market since the pandemic is “painfully slow”, warns Tony Wilson , director at the Institute for Employment Studies : While in every other major economy, employment is at least as high and often much higher than it was before the pandemic, in the UK there are still over a hundred thousand fewer people in work and over three hundred thousand more people out of work. Three years on from the start of the pandemic, it’s clearer than ever that we are being left behind by other major economies. “The main reasons for this appear to be a mix of weak growth, more people out of work with long-term ill health, and fewer older people in work, Wilson explains. He adds: We need to do far better on all three of these issues, particularly with more than three million people who want to work and still over a million unfilled jobs. Figures for long-term ill health are particularly worrying, rising again in the latest data to a new peak of over 2.5 million. This is being driven in particular by people staying out of work longer, rather than more people leaving work now. So we need to focus in particular on how we help those who want to work to get back in – with specialist employment support, faster access to health services and more inclusive recruitment and workplace support.” 7.55am BST The Institute of Directors has welcomed the news that more people are either working or looking for work, which pulled down the UK’s economic inactivity rate . Kitty Ussher , chief economist at the IoD , says: “The labour market remains tight, with a historically high vacancy rate, low unemployment and a low redundancy rate meaning businesses are still finding it hard to recruit. Conversely, for those looking for work, there are plenty of opportunities. “Today’s data also shows a welcome improvement in the inactivity rate, which is down 0.4% on the quarter. This is largely due to younger people being more confident about entering the labour market than they were during the pandemic.” Updated at 7.55am BST 7.49am BST The “longest wages slump in modern history shows no sign of letting up”, warns TUC general secretary Paul Nowak , after real wages fell again ( see earlier post ). Nowak says this pay squeeze is fuelling the current industrial action: “Hard-pressed families can’t take much more. It is no surprise that workers are having to take strike action to defend their living standards. “Ministers should be focused on resolving all of the current pay disputes. “And they must act now to put money in people’s pockets – starting with giving our public sector workers a real pay rise, boosting the minimum wage to £15 as soon as possible, and ending their attack on the right to strike for better pay and conditions in the Strikes Bill.” 7.40am BST Minister for Employment, Guy Opperman MP, says the government is taking steps to help people into work: “Helping more people into work will deliver on our priority to halve inflation and grow the economy, while tackling labour shortages. Today’s figures are encouraging, and I remain focused on supporting those on the lowest incomes to progress in work and build a steady and sustainable future. “To do this we are increasing claimant time with work coaches, and boosting our training and childcare offers to break down barriers for people out of work. But we also recognise the most vulnerable need support as prices climb, which is why we have increased the National Living Wage, extended the Energy Price Guarantee and uprated benefits by 10.1%.” 7.38am BST Hunt: lowering inflation will boost real wages Chancellor the Exchequer, Jeremy Hunt, points out that the UK jobless rate is still low in historic terms. Hunt add that lowering inflation this year will help workers, after today’s data showed a another fall in real pay. “While unemployment remains close to historic lows, rising prices continue to eat into pay cheques which is why halving inflation this year is one of our top economic priorities. “To help families in the meantime, we are making work pay with a record increase in the National Living Wage, while providing cost of living support worth an average of £3,300 per household this year and last, funded through windfall taxes on energy profits.” Another way of raising real wages would be to agree inflation-matching pay rises for public sector workers, of course, as strikes continue to grip parts of the public sector.

Average regular pay growth for the private sector was 6.9% in December 2022 to February 2023, while in the public sector it was only 5.3%. But, the difference between private and public sector growth rates has narrowed in recent months, the ONS says. Across the economy, the finance and business services sector saw the largest regular growth rate at 8.3%, followed by the construction sector at 6.2%. 7.29am BST UK real wages fall as inflation bites pay UK workers continued to suffer from falling real wages at the start of this year, as the cost of living squeeze continued to bite. The ONS reports that regular pay (excluding bonuses) rose by 6.6% per year in December-February, while total pay (including bonuses) was up 5.9%. That pay growth is stronger than economists had expected (basic earnings were forecast to rise by 6.2%). But, wage growth is still lagging behind inflation. In real terms, total pay fell by 3% while regular pay was down 2.3%. The ONS says: A larger fall on the year for real total pay was last seen in February to April 2009 when it fell by 4.5%, but it still remains among the largest falls in growth since comparable records began in 2001.

In January to March 2023, the estimated number of vacancies fell by 47,000, to 1,105,000. That’s the ninth consecutive fall in a row, going back to May to July 2022. Although vacancies are still high in historic terms, it suggests firms are more cautious about hiring as economic growth has stumbled. 7.15am BST UK jobless rate rises to 3.8% The UK unemployment rate has risen, new figures from the Office for National Statistics show. The UK unemployment rate for December 2022 to February 2023 increased by 0.1 percentage points on the quarter to 3.8%. The increase in unemployment, the ONS says, was driven by people unemployed for up to six months. But, the UK employment rate also rose in the quarter, by 0.2 percentage points to 75.8%, lifted by more part-time employees and self-employed workers. Both employment and unemployment rose, because more people re-entered the labour market in the last quarter in the search for work. This pulled down the UK’s economic inactivity rate by 0.4 percentage points, to 21.1% from 21.5%. Headline indicators for the UK labour market for December 2022 to February 2023 show: ▪️ employment was 75.8% ▪️ unemployment was 3.8% ▪️ economic inactivity was 21.1% ➡️ https://t.co/H74cWKP7vB pic.twitter.com/En2dMzowGd — Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) April 18, 2023 The ONS says: The decrease in economic inactivity during the latest three-month period was largely driven by people aged 16 to 24 years. Looking at economic inactivity by reason, the quarterly decrease was largely driven by people inactive because they are students. And in March, the number of staff on payrolls rose by 31,000, to 30.0 million. The number of employees on the payroll rose by 31,000 in March 2023 and is now 986,000 above its pre #COVID19 pandemic level. ➡️ https://t.co/i4DJr99mZx pic.twitter.com/0bOhvboPFq — Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) April 18, 2023 7.15am BST China's GDP growth cheers analysts China’s forecast-beating growth in the last quarter shows that businesses and consumers have been energing from the crippling pandemic disruption of last year. Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management , says: “Economic recovery is well on track. The bright spot is consumption, which is strengthening as household confidence improves. “The strong export growth in March also likely helped to boost GDP growth in Q1.” Elsa Lignos, RBC’s global head of FX strategy, confirms that China’s Q1 GDP growth surprised to the upside at 4.5% y/y. The March key growth indicators showed consumption leading China’s post-Covid economic rebound again. March industrial output and fixed asset investment were both slightly weaker than expected, but the sharp rise in retail sales more than made up for their shortfall. GDP growth is easily on track to hit Beijing’s “around 5%” growth target for the year (and Q2 will have much easier comps), still, the government’s moderate growth target and wariness of debt-fuelled stimulus, along with weak external demand, suggest that China’s growth pick-up will likely plateau by around mid-year. 7.14am BST Introduction: China beats forecasts with 4.5% year-on-year growth Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets, and the world economy. China’s economy has beaten forecasts this morning, as the relaxation of Covid-19 restrictions at the end of last year boosted growth. China’s GDP grew by 4.5% in the January-to-March period, compared with a year ago. It’s the strongest growth recorded by China in a year, in a boost for the global economy. China’s National Bureau of Statistics says the economy “made a good start in the first quarter” of 2023, despite facing a “grave and complex international environment”. Growth was driven by consumption, with China’s retail sales 10.6% stronger than a year ago, following the ending of pandemic restrictions at the start of the year. Industrial production grew by 3.9% per year, while fixed asset investment was 5.1% higher than a year ago. On a quarter-by-quarter basis, GDP grew 2.2% in January-March, up from 0.6% in the final quarter of last year. The GDP report is better than expected, says Iris Pang , ING’s chief economist for Greater China. She predicts it will encourage Beijing’s government to hold back extra stimulus plans. Pang says: Such rapid retail sales growth has not been seen since June 2021, when it grew 12.1%YoY. The growth in retail sales was mainly boosted by catering. China’s currency, the yuan, should benefit from the report, Pang predicts. When comparing the fundamentals of the US and China, China’s economy is strengthening and will get stronger over the rest of the year. In contrast, the US economy will likely continue to slow. Also coming up today UK energy regulators will be banned from forcibly installing prepayment energy meters in the homes of customers aged over-85 in Britain, as part of a new code of conduct. Energy firm representatives will also wear body cameras as part of a new code of conduct, my colleague Alex Lawson explains: Suppliers have agreed to fresh guidelines for putting in the devices when households have run up energy debt after an outcry over agents using court-approved entry warrants to break in to install them. As a result, energy firms will now have to make at least 10 attempts to contact a customer and conduct a “site welfare visit” before a prepayment meter is installed. In response to the prepayment meter scandal, energy firms have now agreed to: - Not forcibly install prepayment meters in homes over over-85s - make at least 10 attempts to contact a customer before installing - make their representatives wear bodycams https://t.co/wiUYpdhSID — Alex Lawson (@MrAlexLawson) April 17, 2023 The latest UK unemployment report, due this morning, will show the state of the labour market.

    "author": "Kevin Rawlinson",
    "content": "A man who fell to his death from a balcony when police fired a Taser last week had been in distress for hours before officers were called, a neighbour has said. Police have not named the man, who was described as quiet, solitary and kind by neighbours in Peckham, south-east London, on Tuesday. Mourners who laid flowers at the scene said they wished they could have done more to help him. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) has opened an investigation after a mandatory referral by Scotland Yard, which has said one of its officers discharged a Taser on the balcony of the high-rise building from which the man was threatening to jump. The force said its officers spent more than an hour trying to convince the man, who is thought to be black, to come down – having been called out at 1.24am on Wednesday 12 April. On Tuesday, Mohamed Bah, a neighbour, said he had seen and heard the man, who lived in the building, shouting about jumping from the balcony many hours earlier than that – while there was daylight. “[The shouting] was for the whole day. I came three or four times in and out of the house. He was up there the whole day, until the night. There was a banging on the door. I don’t know if it was the police or him, but he was saying ‘if you come closer, I am going to jump’.” Another neighbour said: “He always said ‘hi’ to me and that was about it. He would hold the door open. He didn’t seem mean or anything, but he didn’t really talk to anyone.” A note left with some flowers at the scene read: “May your troubled soul at last find peace. I wish we could have done more for you.” On Tuesday, an independent charity that works with families bereaved by state-related deaths called for police to no longer to be the first port-of-call when dealing with mental health crises and other incidents in which the prospect of suicide is being raised. Deborah Coles, the director of Inquest, said: “Once again we see the fatal consequences of the police being first responders to people in mental health crisis and the use of force against black men. It is clear from previous deaths that the use of Tasers and force is prioritised over the care and compassion needed. “This death also raises questions about community mental health services, and whether steps may have been taken to prevent a crisis of this nature. This comes less than a year after the death of Oladeji Omishore, who fell from Chelsea Bridge after being Tasered by police. We stand with all the families bereaved in similar circumstances in asking: when will this end?” An IOPC spokesperson said on Monday: “We have begun an independent investigation into an incident involving Metropolitan police service (MPS) officers on Wednesday (12 April) in south-east London, where a man was seriously injured and later died in hospital after falling from a balcony. “We were advised that MPS officers attended an address in Peckham at around 2am following a report of a man threatening to jump from a balcony on a residential building. “We have established that officers were present for over an hour and attempted to persuade the man to come inside from the balcony. The man has then been tasered while on the balcony and he has fallen several floors to the ground. “The man was transported to hospital with life-threatening injuries and died later the same day. “We received a mandatory referral from the force and declared an independent investigation the next day. Our investigation is in its initial stages and we have secured officers’ body worn footage as we begin gathering evidence.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie .

    "title": "Yousaf reverses key Sturgeon policies as he sets out ‘fresh vision’ for Scotland",
    "author": "Libby Brooks Scotland correspondent",
    "content": "Scotland’s new first minister, Humza Yousaf, has set out a “fresh vision” for his next three years in government that delays, redraws or reverses a number of his predecessor Nicola Sturgeon’s key policies. But opposition leaders said any attempt at a relaunch had been “utterly torpedoed” by the arrest earlier on Tuesday of the SNP treasurer, Colin Beattie , amid the ongoing police investigation into the party’s funding and finances. Making his first major policy statement since he was elected first minister last month, Yousaf told MSPs on Tuesday afternoon that he would delay the controversial deposit return scheme, take plans to restrict alcohol advertising “back to the drawing board” and rejoin two international school league tables in order to increase available comparable data on Scotland’s education performance. Announcing a delay of almost a year to the widely criticised bottle recycling scheme, Yousaf acknowledged that businesses had felt their concerns went unheard by the previous administration, where the scheme was led by the SNP’s governing partners, the Scottish Greens, and promised a reset of the relationship between business and government. Telling Scottish businesses directly that “my door is always open to you”, he said the three missions he was setting out – to tackle poverty, to build a “fair, green and growing” economy, and to improve public services – all depended on a thriving business sector in Scotland. Blaming the UK government for creating uncertainty around the deposit return scheme by delaying the decision to exclude the scheme from the Internal Market Act, Yousaf announced that the launch of the scheme would now be delayed until 1 March, during which time measures will be introduced to simplify the process and support small businesses and hospitality. But the Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, dismissed the statement as “rehashed promises from the past that have never been delivered”. “But what Humza Yousaf can’t escape from is that he is not now running a functioning government. This is an SNP that is mired in scandal, mired in division, talking to themselves and about themselves,” he added. The Scottish Liberal Democrats’ leader, Alex Cole-Hamilton, said: “Everyone, including those SNP backbenchers otherwise engaged today, knows this first minister’s relaunch has been utterly torpedoed. “And while he is focused on the turmoil within his own party, NHS waiting time targets are still being missed, more ferries are breaking down and record amounts of sewage are being dumped into Scotland’s rivers.” In advance of the statement, Kate Forbes – who Yousaf narrowly beat to the leadership – launched an analysis with the pro-independence thinktank Common Weal that called for the Scottish government to do “more with the powers it has” to create a wellbeing economy that will eradicate poverty. Yousaf himself promised to invest a further £1.3bn in the Scottish Child Payment over the next three years and said he would be even bolder on redistributive taxation, as he repeated his campaign pledge to convene an anti-poverty summit, to which he said he would invite experts and those with lived experience of the problem as well as opposition colleagues.",

    "title": "Melbourne gobbled up its surrounds to surpass Sydney. What if it continued forever? | Anna Spargo-Ryan",
    "author": "Anna Spargo-Ryan",
    "content": "Eleven kilometres south of Melbourne are two suburbs that defy the laws of physics. Brighton and its little sister, Brighton East – forming an affluent area rich with boutiques, pilates studios and actual richness – has been steadily spreading into neighbouring suburbs with fewer Phillippa’s Bakeries. Over decades, its ever-expanding boundary has consumed parts of Gardenvale, Bentleigh, Hampton and Elsternwick. This experience speaks to a bold and timeless Melbourne tradition – who doesn’t know someone who doesn’t embellish where they live? Parts of Balwyn were once Box Hill. Malvern East devoured some of Chadstone. Mitcham now suffocates Nunawading, East Bentleigh is chomping through Oakleigh South and Coburg is gradually swamping Fawkner. Some of these suburbs now exist primarily as desolate train stations, many of which are now bypassed on express services anyway. If we find a place we like – to translate for non-Melburnians, higher property prices mean more palatable social standing – we just say everything else is also that place. Related: Melbourne overtakes Sydney as Australia’s most populous city It came as no huge surprise, then, when Melbourne this week became Australia’s most populous city on a technicality. The 2021 census update that expanded Melbourne’s Significant Urban Area bumped our population to 18,700 more than Sydney’s . In our mission to become one heaving boundary encompassing the entire east coast, we have consumed the town-cum-suburb of Melton. This latest change is part of an answer to our city’s favourite question: What if everywhere was Melbourne? I’ve written before about how self-consciously needy Melbourne is . But what of its vastness? Covering almost 10,000 square kilometres , “Greater Melbourne” is six times larger than London and 12 times larger than Paris . Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads It’s unique in Australia’s coastal city landscape, unbounded by silliness like sparkling harbours or warm Indian Oceans. It has scope to expand unimpeded to the north, west and east, steamrolling the Dandenongs and perhaps, one day, constructing a land bridge to Tassie. No other Australian city has Melbourne’s endlessness. To drive from Sunbury in the north-west to Pakenham in the south-east takes in more than 100 kilometres of metropolitan road – almost twice the distance from eastern Sydney to Penrith. One can drive (and perhaps, one day, catch a train) practically forever and still be in the land of oat milk and tennis. There have been times, living here, when I’ve felt as though Melbourne is all that exists. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics – which initiated this recent change – the Significant Urban Area includes “all contiguous urban centres with more than 10,000 people”. Greater Sydney still boasts more people than Greater Melbourne, by a measure of several hundred thousand, but where we will succeed is in the deliberate planning of boundary towns that become suburbs – see Caroline Springs, Craigieburn, Pakenham and Truganina. All we have to do is build houses in the next suburb along. We don’t even have to service them with trains or schools. We can simply chop up some farmland into 600sqm blocks and expand Melbourne for ever. Related: Melbourne or Sydney? The data is in! | Fiona Katauskas There’s a joke about Geelong being a suburb of Melbourne. In the old days, the two cities were separated by vast paddocks and bay views, but that’s no longer the case. The hour-long stretch of freeway is residential from the West Gate to Little River, with three-bedroom houses on standard suburban blocks. One no longer fully leaves Melbourne before spying the red and white smoke stack of Geelong’s famous oil refinery. In fact, G-town has itself been spreading, south and west to build up Waurn Ponds, which in turn is ever encroaching on the previously quaint hamlets of the Surf Coast. Progress (creating unaffordable housing in increasingly surprising locations) continues apace. And so, the already enormous Melbourne grows once again. But maybe that’s by design. One day we will knock on Sydney’s door, having devoured Canberra without even noticing, and point to the great eastern seaboard stretch of residential housing we have constructed. Perhaps, as it turns out, the plan isn’t to beat Sydney for Australia’s largest city but to simply become Sydney … and continue from there.",

    "author": "Sarah Butler",
    "content": "The bakery chain Greggs is to appeal against a ban preventing a central London outlet from selling hot food through the night after police claimed it could lead to a spike in crime and disorder. The company was last summer refused an overnight licence to open its store in Leicester Square between between 11pm and 5am amid claims it could become a “hotspot for late-night disturbances and antisocial behaviour”. The row will be reheated in a three-day appeal hearing at Westminster magistrates court from 16 May. The council’s licensing committee said Greggs “would need to try to convince the court that their evidence provides exceptional reasons for allowing the premises to operate until 5am” in the busy area, which contains numerous bars and restaurants. It is understood that Greggs, which currently operates its Leicester Square outlet from 6am to 11pm, wants to extend its operating hours as nearby competitors including McDonald’s are able to sell hot food into the early hours. Greggs’ application for late-night trading was blocked by Westminster council after the Metropolitan police said fast food premises operating after 11pm attracted those who had been drinking in pubs and bars nearby, with “the likely effect of an increase in crime and disorder in the area and an increased demand on police resources which are already stretched”. Police said the fact that the outlet did not have seating would add to problems with dispersing crowds from around Leicester Square’s gardens. Greggs does not need a licence to sell its trademark sausage rolls and other bakes as they are made elsewhere and not kept hot in store. However, it needs special permission from the local authority to sell hot food and drink including bacon baps, sausage breakfast rolls and potato wedges, as well as tea and coffee, between 11pm and 5am. Greggs said customers could be confused if its full menu was not available to them all evening and this would be more likely to cause trouble. It suggested that its main customers in the early hours were likely to be shift workers and emergency staff, and having deadlines on the purchase of certain products might only encourage loitering. It also offered to provide CCTV, security, and litter control outside its premises.",

    "author": "Sean Ingle",
    "content": "The World Snooker Tour president, Barry Hearn, has called for activists who disrupt sporting events to be jailed to prevent copycat attacks after incidents at the Grand National and World Snooker Championship. \n Hearn’s comments came as he forecast further incidents at Wimbledon and the Open unless Britain became less of a “soft touch as a nation”. He told TalkSport: “Sport’s an easy target. Aintree we saw on Saturday. How long before the Open or Wimbledon or whatever? And it is a concern because, whenever someone intrudes on the field of play, wherever it is, your first thought is not that this could be a protest, but it could be something quite harmful. \n \n Related: Security stepped up amid fears activists will disrupt Derby and Royal Ascot \n \n “We’re such a soft touch as a nation – smack their wrists, give them a small fine, maybe a bit of community hours, maybe a month in prison. It’s a ludicrous situation but what do you do about it? The problem is there’s not enough deterrent out there for these people to do anything but get away with it.” \n Hearn’s intervention came a day after a Just Stop Oil activist threw a packet of orange powder over a snooker table at the Crucible on Monday , forcing the first-round match between Robert Milkins and Joe Perry to be suspended for 24 hours. And last Saturday, 118 activists from Animal Rising were detained after causing the Grand National to be delayed by 14 minutes . \n Hearn believes that without tougher action nothing will change. “It might cost them a few hours of their freedom. But there’s no serious deterrent and, for that reason alone, expect more of these, not less. \n “It therefore puts the onus on promoters like us to say right well, we’re going to have to double up our security, treble up our security, maybe we have to do more body searches … but eventually it puts them off going. Of course all these costs have to be paid for. Custodial sentences is my way. I’m a zero-tolerance type of guy.” \n Hearn’s warning came as London Marathon insiders confirmed they were assessing their security plans for the race on Sunday following recent incidents. \n But organisers remain confident the race will pass without incident after the climate group Extinction Rebellion, which is holding “The Big One” festival this weekend, promised not to target the event. \n “We’re aware of the Extinction Rebellion protest that is scheduled to take place in Parliament Square from Friday 21 April through to Monday 24 April and have been in contact with them for some months,” Hugh Brasher, the event director for the London Marathon, said. \n “The Extinction Rebellion organisers have assured us that they do not wish to disrupt the London Marathon. As Parliament Square and the immediate surrounding area will be very busy, we advise spectators to watch the London Marathon from other locations and avoid the Parliament Square area on the day.” \n Organisers acknowledge the possibility that other groups, such as Just Stop Oil, may still try to stop the race, given they have previously attempted to tie themselves to goalposts during Premier League matches, and invaded the track during the Formula One British Grand Prix at Silverstone last year. \n “As always, we are working closely with the Metropolitan police and other stakeholders on the safety and security of the event,” Brasher said. \n Meanwhile, the World Snooker Tour said extra security measures will be in place for the rest of the world championship, including having guards closer to the floor of play. Only very small bags will be allowed in and will be “vigorously searched”, it said. \n The All England Club has hinted it will step up security for Wimbledon this year in the wake of the recent protests. “The safety and security of all our visitors is paramount,” a spokesperson said. “Throughout the year we work closely with the Metropolitan police and other relevant organisations to ensure that the Championships is as safe and secure as possible and that our plans and measures are commensurate with the threat level and prevailing risks.”",

    "content": "Name: Renting. Age: Ancient – the Romans had laws governing tenancy. Appearance: Like existing, but with an extra layer of misery. Come on, renting isn’t so bad. Yes it is. A recent survey of 2,000 renters aged 20 to 40 by the co-living brand Ark found that 74% had issues with it. Of course, renting can be very expensive. It certainly can. These days the average monthly rent for a room – a room – is £683 nationwide, rising to £952 in London. There must be some place where it’s still cheap to live on this blighted island. Less expensive maybe, but not cheap. A room in Hull will set you back £468 a month – that’s a rise of 14% on last year. No wonder tenants are complaining. Yes, but the rent is not all they’re complaining about. I expect the utility bills are also getting them down. True, energy prices have shot up, and 22% of respondents thought poor insulation was the main drawback to renting. That makes sense. But the overwhelming majority of renters take issue with something else. What’s that? Each other: 93% of those surveyed had noticed downsides to sharing space with flatmates. Really? Don’t they like the company? Not as much as they hate cleaning up after others (54%), putting up with their noise (41%), or the way housemates waste energy (38%), steal food (29%) and spend too much time in the shower (24%). How intolerant. I live with a bunch of people and I find them all to be considerate, tidy, respectful and easy going. You know what they say: if you can’t name the annoying flatmate in your shared accommodation, then the annoying flatmate is you. Is that why the rest of them stop talking when I come into the kitchen to eat yoghurt with crisps in it? Is it even your yoghurt? I thought it was house yoghurt. Do the 20- to 40- year- old renters of today have nothing good to say about their flatmates? They admit they make renting more affordable. Not just more affordable, but possible. True – living alone is a pipe dream for most tenants in 2023. I would hate living alone, and having to clean stuff and buy my own food. Well, 32% also said they appreciated their flatmates’ support in difficult times. That’s what I can provide: a shoulder to cry on. But you’re the reason everyone is crying. Do say: “Renting is a nightmare, but hell is other people.” Don’t say: “Sorry, were those your Coco Pops?”",

    "author": "Zoe Williams",
    "content": "Since 52-year-old German artist Boris Eldagsen went public with the fact that he won a Sony world photography award with an AI-generated image , relations between him and the award body have soured. The World Photography Organisation has issued a statement, saying: “We no longer feel we are able to engage in a meaningful and constructive dialogue with him.” His website reads: “Sony: Stop saying nonsense!” “I don’t know why they behaved like this,” he says, speaking to me from Berlin on the morning after the controversy broke. But I have a fair idea: plainly, they feel like they were conned, and had their aesthetic discernment called into question. If you can’t tell the difference between a photograph and an AI-generated image, then you may as well go home. (Boris Eldagsen has said that, prior to being informed of his win, he had not provided any information to the World Photography Organisation that the image was AI-generated; the organisation says that the judges were always aware this was an image created using elements of AI.) But maybe both parties are being both too hard and too easy on themselves. Maybe, when done well enough, AI images can’t be distinguished from photography by anybody. And yet, as Eldagsen says, “I love photography, I love generating images with AI, but I’ve realised, they’re not the same. One is writing with light, one is writing with prompts. They are connected, the visual language was learned from photography, but now AI has a life of its own. If people want to be silent and not talk about that, that’s wrong.” Eldagsen grew up in south-west Germany: “low culture, forest, medieval castles, Roman leftovers, very close to the French border. If that’s fine for you, it’s great to stay there. If you’re looking for art and culture, you have to leave, as I did when I was 20.” He studied philosophy at university in Cologne, then photography and fine art in Mainz, and after that, he tells his life through a succession of love affairs: the girlfriend who persuaded him to study for a term in Hyderabad, in India; the Australian artist who got him to move to Australia; the psychologist partner who diagnosed his ADHD, which he says explains his hyperfocus: “If you love what you do, you are more efficient than a non-ADHD person.” He’s a one-off, a roamer, he conceives countries as people: “It’s always strange, if you’ve lived in Australia, to spend time in the UK. It’s like you had a relationship with the daughter and now you come and spend time with mum.” He says the only way to make British people laugh is by talking about Nazis, which Germans have trained themselves not to do. I tell him he doesn’t have to talk about any Nazis. His work was always conceptual rather than figurative, long before he started working with AI. “My approach to photography was psychological and philosophical. It was a journey inside; it was not depicting what everybody sees in front of them. Having that background, AI fascinated me. It was built from the collective unconscious. I also saw that the way it works can be related to Plato’s theory of ideas [also known as the theory of forms ].” OK, it may help here to consider the image, and how it was made. Or it may not help. Let’s give it a shot. It’s a black-and-white portrait of two women, the older one behind with her hands, weathered to the point of being misshapen, on the younger woman’s shoulders. It may be a wedding day – that is suggested as much in the interplay of trepidation and disillusionment in the four watchful eyes as it is in the subtle finery of the maybe-bride’s white dress. The image is called The Electrician, from the series Pseudomnesia , another term for false memory – which could have been a breadcrumb trail for the judges, but never mind them. It’s an immensely evocative scene, conjuring so much about the human condition and its timelessness – hell, that’s probably why it won in the first place. But that’s also why it is so unsettling that a machine made it. Except a human was involved, of course. “The process has many steps, it’s not putting in three words and clicking ‘generate’,” Eldagsen explains. “I identified 11 parts of the prompt; you create an image with text prompt, then when you want to leave the frame, do something to the image outside of the painting [for example, create imperfections to the surface, as there are on The Electrician], then again you have to describe, ‘What do I want to appear?’” His adventures in AI haven’t given him an identity crisis as a photographer, because he was never in love with the idea of a single, unified author in the first place. “It was always a collaboration. I’ve been working in teams with artist friends for 25 years.” And he emphatically doesn’t see the process of building an AI image as dehumanised, or even one in which the human is sidelined. “I don’t see it as a threat to creativity. For me, it really is setting me free. All the boundaries I had in the past – material boundaries, budgets – no longer matter. And for the first time in history, the older generation has an advantage, because AI is a knowledge accelerator. Two thirds of the prompts are only good if you have knowledge and skills, when you know how photography works, when you know art history. This is something that a 20-year-old can’t do.” Where Plato comes in is that his theory of forms – that there’s an ideal version of, for instance, a table, and every real-life iteration of a table is merely an imitation, a version of the original idea - is outsourced to the algorithm, which stores all the iterations, holds the knowledge of our collective unconscious. Eldagsen says, “Many people, when they complain about AI, say it’s copying and stealing. It’s not, it’s learning the Platonic theory.” The real challenge presented by AI is not that it might rock our attachment to human creativity as somehow unique and unfathomable – though who likes it when that happens? – nor even that it may destroy jobs and, potentially, whole industries – though that’s not great either. “The threat,” Eldagsen says, “is to democracy and to photojournalism; we have so many fake images, we need to come up with a way to show people what is what.” You might think you’re all over fake news, but the tech has moved faster than the conversation. Mick Gordon, studying for a PhD in AI at Queen Mary’s in Belfast, explains: “Rudimentary AI is specific pattern recognition. It’s really tricky, and it still has hallucinations, or struggles to recognise the difference between a dog and a cat. The panic is, ultimately, you’re going to have truth, and you’re going to have reality, and reality’s going to be a mixture of truth, hallucinations – that’s what they call it when the machine does something weird – and deliberate non-truth. Propaganda used to deliver a singular message to the exclusion of other messaging. Now propaganda will just deluge you with everything.” The question isn’t, “Who made this art, a human or a machine?” or “Can machine-art be real?” It’s more fundamental: how much truth is there in my reality? Or maybe those are all the same question; Plato would know. Related: ‘We got bored waiting for Oasis to re-form’: AIsis, the band fronted by an AI Liam Gallagher Eldagsen suggests, in the first instance, a sort of traffic-light system: AMG, where news images are labelled “authentic, manipulated or generated. The facts take so much time, so many people. We need to have a structure to support the press, they can’t do it on their own.” But this is part of a much larger conversation about forcing distinctions between photography and AI-generated images. Giving it a name would be a start: “promptography” is Eldagsen’s suggestion. “It’s complex,” he says, “and because it’s complex, it needs a discussion. [My image] was shared so many times that it’s reaching the press and I’m very happy about that. Mission accomplished. I’m happy to play my part.” • This article was amended on 19 April 2023 to add the position of the World Photography Organisation that the competition judges were always aware the image in question was created using elements of AI.",

    "author": "Dan Sabbagh Defence and security editor",
    "content": "The senior Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood has accused the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, of concealing a potential Russian “act of war” against an RAF spy plane, during an emergency debate in the Commons. \n The chair of the defence select committee questioned an account given by Wallace to parliament of the dangerous incident, which occurred last September and was revealed last week in a leak of hundreds of top secret Pentagon documents as a “near-shoot down”. \n Ellwood, who had asked the speaker for permission to discuss the security breach, asked whether “too much information” was “now classified as top secret” – meaning the public was sometimes unaware of threats facing the UK. \n The MP went on to ask “if a Russian Su-27 [fighter] did deliberately attempt to fire a missile on an RAF Rivet Joint over the Black Sea last September”, referring to a fresh report of the incident that emerged as a result of the leak. \n It suggested the mid-air incident was more serious than Wallace portrayed when he briefed MPs about it in October, prompting Ellwood to argue it was “an act of war, the details of which surely should be publicised, not hidden away in intelligence reports”. \n US defence sources told the New York Times that the Russian pilot had locked on to the British aircraft and, believing they had permission to fire, shot a missile. However, the missile malfunctioned. The specialised RAF aircraft can carry up to 30 crew members. \n At the time the defence secretary told the Commons that a Russian fighter jet had “released a missile in the vicinity” of the Rivet Joint surveillance aircraft, and that it was “incredibly lucky” a tense situation had not become worse. But he sought to cool the issue, arguing “we do not consider it to have been a deliberate escalation”. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Wallace was not in the Commons on Tuesday to respond. The defence secretary is on a two-day trip to Washington DC, meeting his US counterpart, Lloyd Austin, and members of Congress, where he would be expected to discuss the fallout from the leaks as well as the state of the war in Ukraine. \n The junior defence minister James Heappey, responding for the government, said he could not comment on the content of any of the documents, even though they have been widely circulating in US, UK and international media. “That these apparently leaked documents are in the public domain does not change their classification and thus the degree that any minister or official can comment on their context,” the minister told MPs, declining to reply in detail. \n Heappey said “some of these documents have been manipulated” for disinformation purposes, although there is no evidence the spy plane document or many of the others had been altered before being placed online. \n One document was digitally altered by a Russian blogger to exaggerate estimates of Ukrainian casualties and reduce the Russian figures, but the forgery was crude and was soon detected when compared with earlier versions leaked online. \n John Healey, the shadow defence secretary, asked if Wallace would “make a statement to parliament on his return” to tell MPs what reassurances had been received from the Pentagon “on how British intelligence is handled”. Heappey, however, did not commit to his boss coming back to brief MPs. \n Raw intelligence collected by the Five Eyes countries – the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand – is normally pooled, meaning it is likely some of the top secret files will be based on information collected by the British. Many of the leaked reports are marked “FVEY” – for sharing between the five countries.",

    "title": "EPA’s water testing after Menindee fish kill was flawed and insufficient, expert says",
    "author": "Fleur Connick",
    "content": "Scientists have raised concerns about the accuracy of government water testing results from Menindee after a mass fish kill last month, with one saying if it were a first year university assignment, he would fail them. \n The New South Wales Environment Protection Authority (EPA) this week released the long-awaited test results on six water samples taken from the Darling-Baaka River almost one month ago, on 21 March. The samples were collected five days after millions of fish were reported to be floating on the river’s surface around the town of Menindee in far west NSW. \n Dr Ian Wright, a professor of environmental science at Western Sydney University, said if the EPA’s test results were an assignment submitted to him by one of his students, he would score it 3.5/10. \n \n Related: Menindee farmers scramble for stock water after tests show river has ‘potentially toxic algae’ \n \n “If this was a first year assignment, I’d fail them,” he said. “This is a complex and dynamic situation. We should have multiple days of data for something of this magnitude. \n “This would not get published in science [journals] … it is not commensurate with the seriousness of the environmental emergency here.” \n The NSW government has announced an inquiry into the fish deaths led by the state’s chief scientist, Prof Hugh Durrant-Whyte. The terms of reference are being finalised. \n \n Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter \n \n Wright said he was “so thankful” there would be a “high quality” inquiry into the event, particularly in light of concerns around the testing. \n He listed multiple concerns with the methodology behind the EPA’s tests which he said would affect the accuracy of the results. They included: \n \n The water samples were taken on 21 March, five days after the fish kill event began on 16 March. \n The samples were collected by Water NSW, not the EPA. \n Six samples do not provide an adequate sample size to draw accurate conclusions from. \n Only one sample was taken at each of the six locations. He said multiple samples should have been taken as results can vary depending on whether samples were taken from the surface or deeper in the river. \n Bacteria were not tested, and it should have been given there were millions of fish rotting in the water. \n \n The EPA published an overview on 6 April and released the full results after questions from Guardian Australia. The full results included tests for nutrients, algae toxins, metals and pesticides. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n One of the samples, collected from the Darling River upstream of Menindee Creek, showed ammonia levels that were more than 50 times the Australian and New Zealand Guidelines for fresh and marine water quality. Wright said that in his opinion that amounts to “severe pollution”. The EPA has not described it as a pollution event, saying test results showed the major fish kill was not caused by pesticides. \n At the same sample site, the dissolved oxygen was 0.41mg/L. According to the EPA, dissolved oxygen lower than 1mg/L can be deadly for aquatic animals. \n With those ammonia levels, in combination with the very low oxygen, Wright said he can’t “imagine much surviving”. \n The EPA said it was working closely with a number of government agencies in response to the Menindee fish kill incident and has had multiple staff on the ground since 18 March. \n “The EPA can investigate fish kills, often in conjunction with other NSW government agencies and local councils,” the EPA said. “The EPA requested WaterNSW to collect samples while they were doing monitoring in the river. All samples were sent to an accredited laboratory.” \n \n Related: At Menindee, the lifeblood of the people has turned to bitter sludge \n \n Prof Fran Sheldon, a river ecologist who was on the independent panel which investigated the 2019 Menindee fish kills , said she doesn’t think the NSW government agencies were “hiding anything or trying to cover up data” but that there should have been greater transparency. \n “They probably should have just been testing daily and making it freely available,” she said. “I’m not sure why they wouldn’t have been testing through the whole thing once they realised it was happening.” \n In a statement, WaterNSW said it operates the Menindee lakes system under a strict regulatory framework and had worked with other agencies since October 2022, when “the likelihood of a flood-related blackwater event started to increase”, to mitigate the worst impacts. \n “WaterNSW anticipates that these operations will feature in the NSW government’s inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the fish kill and will support that inquiry as the most appropriate forum to explore these matters,” it said. \n Sheldon said the challenge for WaterNSW will be to ensure that enough water flows through the system to flush the blackwater. \n “They still have to let some water down to connect through those water holes that are chockas full of fish that will have declined water quality,” she said. “Because if they don’t, next summer we’re going to see a 2019 event.” \n \n Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter \n Join the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community",

    "author": "Amy Remeikis",
    "content": "Rural Australia and Tasmania will receive almost no benefit from the $250bn stage-three tax cuts, a new analysis has found, with Jacqui Lambie hardening her stance against them. \n Research by the Australia Institute has concluded rural and regional communities will receive the least benefit from the controversial final stage of the Morrison government tax reforms, given their comparatively lower earnings. \n Nationals electorates and Tasmania, outside Hobart, are among those who will see the least flow-on effects from the final stage, where almost half of the benefit will go to people earning more than $180,000. \n \n Related: Redesigned stage-three tax cuts among options that could halve $50bn budget deficit, report says \n \n Lambie, whose vote gave the Coalition the support it needed to pass the tax package in 2019 but has since called for stage three’s scrapping given the change in economic circumstances, said there was no justification for continuing with stage three it as legislated. \n “It’s arse about face, giving money to people like me who don’t need it and giving nothing to the people who are screaming for assistance,” she said. \n Lambie believes the package can be tapered to give more benefit to people at the bottom end. \n “This idea that it will be inflationary is just bullshit. They won’t be spending it at shops, they’ll be paying their bills. We’ve got to do something to help people being wiped off their feet.” \n Using taxation statistics and figures from the Parliamentary Budget Office, the Australia Institute has calculated a winners and losers list in terms of benefits from the final stage. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The Tasmanian electorates of Lyons, Braddon and Bass are least likely to benefit from the tax reforms, with researchers estimating just $130m in combined value will flow through to people living in those seats. \n The seat of Spence in South Australia and Maranoa in rural Queensland round off the bottom five. Hinkler in regional Queensland, Franklin in outer metro Tasmania, Lyne and Page in rural New South Wales and Nicholls in rural Victoria finish off the bottom 10. \n The institute calculates taxpayers in the bottom 20 electorates – including Blaxland, Fowler, Lingiari, New England, Mallee, Wide Bay, Calwell, Kingston, Indi and Monash – will pay just $1.1bn less tax in 2024-25 because of the stage three changes. \n \n Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \n \n By comparison, taxpayers in the top 20 electorates that are expected to benefit – led by independently held North Sydney, Wentworth, Warringah, Curtin and Tanya Plibersek’s electorate of Sydney – will pay $4.8bn less tax in that same year. \n Taxpayers in the top five electorates will pay less tax due to stage three than the bottom 20 electorates combined. \n Matt Grundoff, senior economist at the Australia Institute, said the tax cuts would just widen the divide between the city and the bush, rich and poor . \n \n Related: From stage-three tax cuts to welfare relief: what’s on Australia’s 2023 budget wishlist? \n \n Lambie’s colleague Senator Tammy Tyrrell said it was now up to MPs to advocate for their communities. \n “Take a look at Lyons,” she said. “They’re getting the least of any electorate in the country. But it’s represented by an MP who won’t go against the party line and speak out about these unaffordable tax cuts. \n “Stage three should be postponed by a year, revised, and taken to the next election.” \n The Greens have been calling for an end to stage three almost since the policy was were first floated, while the Liberal MP Bridget Archer has said she was “open minded about considering any possible or proposed changes” to the legislation. \n Labor remains committed to the reforms it helped legislate, with Anthony Albanese saying as recently as Tuesday there were no plans to change it. \n “Well, I’ve said every time I’ve been asked about this for some period of time that there’s been no change in the government’s position,” he said. \n • This article was amended on 19 April 2023. A figure of $48bn in the Australia Institute report should have been $4.8bn.",

    "author": "Cait Kelly",
    "content": "Students are being left with as little as $13 a day to live on as the youth allowance fails to keep pace with soaring rents, a new analysis from Homelessness Australia shows. The report compared the cost of sharing an average two-bedroom apartment against the maximum income support payments available to young student renters, revealing they are left with little money to cover food, transport, medicine, utilities and other costs. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Youth allowance has increased by 10% to $562.80 over the last two years with CPI indexing, while the maximum rent assistance is $157.20. But rents have surged ahead 24%. Since March last year, the national median advertised rent price increased from $450 to $500 to reach a historical high, recent data from PropTrack showed. Related: Rental crisis: Airbnb and holiday home owners urged to let properties out to long-term renters A young person who paid 64% of their income two years ago to share a two-bedroom unit would now have to pay 73% of it, said Kate Colvin, the chief executive of Homelessness Australia. “Our government has said they wouldn’t leave anyone behind, but we’ve got people who are on the lowest income support, young people who get less than people on jobseeker, who absolutely can’t afford the rent and three meals a day,” Colvin said. “This is not an acceptable situation in a country like Australia. “The reality is landlords will not rent to a young person whose budget is stretched this thinly, making it almost impossible for young people who can’t live safely at home to find somewhere to live.” Interactive Trenton Hoare, who uses they/them pronouns, receives $674.60 for youth allowance and pays $400 for a room in a two-bedroom apartment in Hobart. When Hoare moved to Hobart from Devonport in 2021 they were paying $574 for student accommodation near the University of Tasmania campus. This left just $100 a fortnight for groceries, bills and other expenses. “That was pretty much peanuts and pain,” Hoare said. “Over 70% of my income was going straight to rent in university accommodation.” Hoare knew it was unsustainable. But after deciding to move out in July it took them six months to find something within their budget. Hoare now works about 15 hours a week to survive. “It’s taken me about a year to find a casual job that was flexible with my university studies,” Hoare said. “Without it, I would be able to afford the rental but I would have barely any money left to support myself in that way of groceries and bills. “It’s just a complete shambles.” Related: Most Australian renters think third-party applications require too much private data, Choice survey finds The latest figures from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare show each year 39,300 children and young people aged 15-24 access homelessness services. Colvin said this was increasing as young people struggled to make ends meet during the rental crisis. “It’s not just young people who are fleeing an unsafe family environment, but young people who are just not able to afford the rent,” Colvin said. She called on the federal government to raise welfare payments to $76, so students and young people can cover the basics. “By failing to act, we are condemning growing numbers of young people to homelessness and poverty,” she said. “It’s impossible to develop skills and experience or attain an education when you’re hungry or unsure of where you will sleep.”",

    "title": "Justice for King of the Hill: a better, more prophetic show than its 90s peers",
    "author": "Nathan Jolly",
    "content": "Thanks to the popularity of a jaundiced, four-fingered family named the Simpsons, the 90s saw a flood of adult animation aimed at a new generation of disaffected twentysomethings caught between the Saturday morning cartoons that babysat them through their sugar-cereal childhoods and the MTV programming that weaponised flashy colours and slam-editing to hold an increasingly distracted audience hostage. The likes of Daria and Beavis and Butt-head took apathy and disenchantment to new heights; South Park offended everyone without prejudice. Ren and Stimpy brought stoners to Nickelodeon, while Fox fortified its animation domination by launching both Family Guy and Futurama in 1999. Despite lasting for 13 seasons and offering a sublime skewering of sociopolitical life, Mike Judge’s King of the Hill has somewhat slipped off the radar since its initial run. Debuting in 1997, the same year as South Park, King of the Hill offered a softer touch and a wider scope than its contemporaries. With the burnt coffee expanses of its Texan locale, some truly accurate rendering of the backwaters and trailer parks of redneck America, and the laconic drawl of its characters, the pace is – at first – confusing for a cartoon. There is little slapstick, no real exaggeration in the animation style, and an outsized importance on the sale of propane and propane accessories. Related: Make it so! Star Trek: The Next Generation remains radically hopeful television Central to the show’s draw is its patriarch, Hank Hill (voiced by Judge), a proud assistant manager at Strickland Propane, a seemingly dull role that Hank infuses with every ounce of the passion he once showed for high school football. Hank is a straight shooter with an unshakable moral core, a short back and sides, and a strident belief in US exceptionalism. He supports the troops, values community spirit and hard work, and watches with a disapproving eye as his son – the chubby, ungraceful Bobby (voiced by Pamela Adlon) – indulges in any pursuit he deems “feminine”, including theatre and propcomedy. Like any man with unexamined principles, Hank can be rigid to a fault. His close-mindedness is often played for laughs and the values he holds dear are eroding in ways he can’t quite articulate. As the show’s co-creator Greg Daniels said in 1997, as it was debuting: “He’s upset about how America is changing, and he doesn’t know what to do about it.” At the turn of the century King of the Hill’s portrayal of a frustrated man left behind by the changing times was quaint. In 2023 it seems downright prophetic. This year, as government watchdogs issued a scathing report of the Capitol Hill insurrection, Hulu announced it would be rebooting King of the Hill. If the show had continued to run throughout the Trump presidency, you can bet your last propane tank that Hank’s best friend and neighbour, Dale Gribble – the funniest and most troubling character on the show – would have been leading said riots. Gribble is the perfect representative of the subset that has become more and more vocal since the demise of King of the Hill and the rise of the far-right: a paranoid gun-nut, touting anti-government conspiracy theories to anyone who will listen. Related: Language Lessons: a film about video calls sounds like Covid revisited – but it will grab you by the feels He is a licensed bounty hunter, runs a pest control business that operates as a thin metaphor of his bleak worldview and is proud president of a gun club. He spouted wild ramblings of fake news decades before Trump did and the only time he bends on his distrust of the US government is when he lets a JFK conspiracy take him down a pro-government rabbit hole too complicated to summarise here. In short, Dale Gribble was the face of alt-right America before such a thing even existed. King of the Hill’s final episode aired in 2010; by then it had long stopped airing in Australia. But while there are dated references throughout, the show has aged considerably better than all of its peers, save for a handful of truly great Simpsons seasons. Hank may even prove to be a wise voice in these times. Those who believe everything is changing too quickly could do a lot worse than to turn to Hank as an example: a proud man, long set in his ways, who makes his way respectfully through a world he no longer fully understands.

    "content": "Is an unhinged, despondent and possibly suicidal person well-placed to help others who are at risk – because they can relate to them? This challenging and arguably problematic idea bubbles away in Stan’s six-part series Totally Completely Fine, starring Thomasin McKenzie as an impertinent twentysomething who drinks, smokes dope, takes illicit substances and … inherits a waterfront property! The circumstances are sad: the house is bequeathed to McKenzie’s character, Vivian, by her grandfather. But the digs are pretty sweet. There’s a catch, though: located metres from a cliff front, the property regularly attracts people who are thinking of ending it all. Gramps saved many lives by talking strangers down and inviting them inside for a cuppa. Will Vivian do the same? Totally Completely Fine is hardly archetypal but its hero’s journey is as apparent as any story about warriors or hobbits: a reluctant protagonist initially refuses a call to adventure before taking up the quest. The trailer for Totally Completely Fine In the first episode Vivian saves a runaway bride, Amy (Contessa Treffone), through rather brusque methods – introducing herself by shouting “Oi!” then asking: “What the fuck are you doing?” Not exactly a peer-reviewed counselling method. The obvious question is whether the protagonist will embrace a newfound purpose in assisting others. But, weirdly, the series more or less jetpacks out of this interesting premise, choosing to focus on Vivian’s relationships with friends, family and lovers. Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning We soon discover there’s tension between Vivian and her highly strung gay brother John (Rowan Witt), whose vegan food truck she burnt down after puffing on a bacon-flavoured vape. Her other brother, Hendrix (Brandon McClelland), is more tolerant of her rowdy ways. Related: Last Night in Soho review – a deliciously twisted journey back to London’s swinging past McKenzie, who was excellent as the vacant-eyed, haunted protagonist of Edgar Wright’s time-bending thriller Last Night in Soho, imbues the lead role with a compelling, slightly dangerous and volatile energy, as if parts of her psyche could combust at any moment. Visually, the show also jabs at Vivian’s psyche, by inserting visions from her past in quickly edited sequences that borrow from horror movie syntax and scream “THIS PERSON IS TROUBLED”. The cuts mean more than the images, reiterating psychological instability. But as the series progresses a fuller picture of past trauma forms. Totally Completely Fine loops back to these images in a circular approach that moves around various scenarios rather than progressing the plot. Its creator, Gretel Vella, bakes into the show’s premise the opportunity for an ongoing array of heightened dramatic scenarios and interesting characters. But the story gets distracted from its bedrock idea – Vivian rising to the challenge and saving lives – as if the writers simply forgot and moved on. Attempts to create a lightness of touch sometimes fare poorly. One scene in the second episode depicts Vivian’s psychologist neighbour Dane (Devon Terrell) teaching her and Amy how to deal with suicidal ideation. But it feels tonally off, as if it’s channelling the inspirational spirit of a movie training montage. “Hop on up, this is your ledge!” Dane says, gesturing towards the base of a disused fountain, before asking them to sprint to the front door, which has a hand-drawn picture of a telephone affixed to it. “Let’s go, come on, faster, faster!” he yells. Related: Aunty Donna’s Coffee Cafe review – sketch comedy trio scramble for laughs in new show The darker elements can be iffy too. Its depiction of trauma – through Vivian’s flashbacks – feels overly simplistic, all directions pointing back to one formative incident. Even Dane would disapprove! The traumatic incident in question “didn’t make you like this”, he tells Vivian. “You choose how you are.” We have a character saying one thing while the show’s form and structure communicates another: a strange schism in the writing that’s never reconciled. Eventually, as percolating dramas boil over, scenarios get embarrassingly contrived and on the nose, with a stretch in the last episode that wouldn’t look – or sound , given the schmaltzy dialogue – out of place in a cheesy Hollywood romcom. For a much better combination of provocative comedy and pointy drama, check out the under-appreciated 2021 series The End , which wittily explores the issue of assisted dying. Unlike Totally Completely Fine, it never loses sight of its premise or what distinguishes it from countless other productions.

    "title": "Queensland among worst violators of children’s rights in youth justice system, research finds",
    "author": "Eden Gillespie",
    "content": "Queensland is among the worst offenders for violating children’s rights in the youth justice system, with an ex-detainee claiming police treat young people “like scum”, according to new research. The report released by Save the Children on Wednesday found Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia have adopted “tough on crime” measures to youth justice instead of a “child’s rights approach”, which would be more effective and humane. In those three jurisdictions, the use of excessive force, restraint and adult facilities to detain children were identified as significant breaches of children’s rights. Mat Tinkler, chief executive of Save the Children Australia, said Australia’s youth justice system “is responsible for repeated, egregious breaches of children’s rights, often resulting in direct harm to many children”. Related: Queensland government to ‘investigate’ 32-day detention of child, 13 “We are a nation that prides ourselves on giving everyone an opportunity to succeed, and yet authorities are setting children and young people up to fail,” he said. Queensland overrode its Human Rights Act in February to make breach of bail an offence for children in light of “community concern” after a series of high-profile crimes. Shane*, a former Queensland detainee, told Save the Children that police officers in watchhouses ignored requests for medical assistance and hit young people when cameras weren’t switched on. “Sometimes [the police] can be all right, other times they just treat us like scum,” he told the charity. “They like to swear at us, they like to hit us when the cameras are not on.” Shane, 18, is on remand. He’s been in and out of detention since the age of 13, with his latest stay in a Queensland watch house totalling nine days. Save the Children’s Australian service delivery arm – 54 reasons – has helped Shane through their bail support services, which they provide in Queensland, WA and Tasmania. A Queensland police (QPS) spokesperson said “individual watchhouses facilitate a young person’s right to have access to legal representation, support and education”. “As the Youth Justice Act 1992 prohibits disclosure of confidential information about young people we are unable to provide anything further,” they said. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The state’s youth justice minister, Leanne Linard, said the bail changes “were not taken lightly” and the government had “listened to the community and acted in the interests of community safety”. In WA, boys have been sent to Casuarina prison , a maximum security facility for adults. Last year the state banned a dangerous restraint technique it had been using on children after criticism. “Urgent attention” is also needed in the NT, the report says. Critics have condemned laws passed in 2021 which automatically place children into police custody if they commit serious breaches of bail. Youth crime rates in Australia have steadily decreased over the past 10 years, but the majority of young people in the youth justice system have not been sentenced, the report says. Related: Queensland passes controversial youth crime laws after heated human rights debate Data shows almost half of the children in detention in 2020-21 were Indigenous despite representing just 6% of the population aged 10-17. Tinkler said governments “must invest in strengthening and expanding early intervention and diversion programs”. “The punitive and ‘tough on crime’ approaches of Australian governments are the opposite of this,” he said. The charity also wants the age of criminal responsibility to be increased from 10 to 14 years or older, independent oversight of youth detention facilities and limitations on solitary confinement and strip-searches on children. A spokesperson for the federal attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, said the government was “working closely with state and territory governments on the issue of raising the minimum age of criminal responsibility”. The spokesperson said the government was paying “particular attention” to addressing the overrepresentation of First Nations children in the criminal justice system. *Name changed to protect the individual’s privacy",

    "title": "Mrs Davis review – fun yet frustrating series mixes religion with raucousness",
    "author": "Charles Bramesco",
    "content": "As a Jewish artist’s reverent yet not-quite-credulous meditations on Christian myth, there’s a fascinating theological tension at play in the TV work of Damon Lindelof. Lost and The Leftovers deconstructed the question of the afterlife in the face of definitive proof that it exists, and his miniseries reworking of Watchmen posited the omnipotent Doctor Manhattan as a fallible God figure. He respects the great quandaries of religion enough to take them seriously, though his interrogations of the sacred always include a few doses of sniggering profanity. This balance of skepticism and belief takes intriguing new form in Lindelof and co-creator Tara Hernandez’s new Peacock series Mrs Davis, which constructs a metaphorically pliable deity in a distant cousin of Siri and Alexa. Related: The Last Thing He Told Me review – Jennifer Garner is as wooden as her fancy salad bowls The artificial intelligence referred to by the unsettlingly personal sobriquet of the title lives in an earbud worn by users in every corner of the globe, with the defiant exception of nun Simone (Betty Gilpin, a commanding cowgirlish presence in her cornflower habit). Raised by magicians, married to Jesus Christ in a capacity made quite literal by surreal interludes taking place at His celestial falafel restaurant, she doesn’t trust the technological panopticon bent on flushing all the mystique from the world. Lindelof and Hernandez’s amply founded impulses toward Luddism don’t come off as fogeyish, however, channeled as they are toward a grander parable about the paramount importance of cultivating a critical relationship with the Almighty. The showrunners are less preoccupied with smartphones than the lockstep mentality our gadgets can foster, a concern easily translated to the difference between the devout and the blindly zealous. In typically Lindelofian fashion, the path to this hard-won pearl of enlightenment can be long, circuitous, inscrutable, fleetingly transcendent and often dumb (in the good, deliberate way, and in the less-good, tiresome way). Mrs Davis sends Simone on a quest to locate the Holy Grail in exchange for the program’s volitive self-destruction, the mission’s many detours sometimes bogged down by non sequiturs a mite too pleased with their own random cleverness. A heist to retrieve a diving suit owned by Simone’s late father (David Arquette) from the secret lair of her draconian mother (Elizabeth Marvel) makes for suspenseful, captivating television; an hourlong exposition dump concerning her entwined fate with ex Wiley (Jake McDorman), a fateful liver transplant and a conspiracy in the form of a sneaker advertising campaign, less so. The jokes written into dialogue rather than left as big structural ironies fall flat about as often as they don’t, their teen-boy tonality – lots of four-letter words incredulously repeated – a possible reflection of Hernandez’s credits on The Big Bang Theory and Young Sheldon. The show loosens up enough to poke fun at its own convolutions, the characters themselves somewhat lost on how eight hours’ worth of plot points connect to each other. That’s where the faith comes in; even when things don’t make strict sense, they foggily cohere into ideas that do. There’s an earnest spirit of searching inquiry in Simone’s intimate negotiations with Christ and the unseen, capricious God he refers to as “the Boss”, her steadfast devoutness tempered by the testing of doubt. She charts a hard-fought middle path through Christian orthodoxy, emphasizing individualism and choice along with trust in a benevolent higher authority. The sensual, tender exchanges between Simone and “JC”, among the show’s most poignant, convey the profound nourishment of the soul that the true believer gets from the power to which they surrender. The pure God-fearing sincerity of Simone’s arc casts a harsh light on the constant counterplotting that checks in with a brick-headed squadron of “resistance fighters” scheming to take down Mrs Davis. They’re led by JQ (Chris Diamantopoulos doing Crocodile Dundee), a thong-clad commando caricature who seems to have barged in from a different, broader show. He and his flunkies repeatedly fumble their way across Simone and Wiley’s path, each run-in a reminder of the drastic gulf between the writing’s comedic strengths and weaknesses. Cheeky touches of sacrilege like a rodeo competition featuring the Jeza-Bull go down far easier than a hammered-into-the-ground gag about an extension bar called The Constipator. The combination of high rapture and low humor should gel with the overall mode of absurdity, but the latter side of that duality lacks inspiration in its doofusery. The streaming format turns out to be a felicitous fit for Lindelof’s mystery-box storytelling style; having the first four episodes available at once helps to cut through the inkling that we’re being strung along from week to week by withheld information, a sensation that can nag at the more opaquely confounding moments. Much like that God he’s so fond of, Lindelof wants following him to be doable if challenging, and frequently rewarding. Though in that same respect, the mysterious ways in which he works can be just as frustrating. Mrs Davis begins on Peacock on 20 April with a UK date to be announced",

    "title": "Imagine a world where doctors and pharmacists got along | Ranjana Srivastava",
    "author": "Ranjana Srivastava",
    "content": "On the ward, we are debating the addition of a third drug to control an elderly patient’s labile blood pressure when the pharmacist asks if I am sure. The years have taught me that this represents a testing of the waters to see how receptive a doctor might be to advice. “What do you suggest?” I ask. “I could check with his pharmacy whether he has been filling his existing scripts.” The suggestion is soft, almost apologetic, but she is right. The local pharmacist who has known him for decades says that since his son died, the man’s self-care has faltered. This nugget of information helps us avoid another drug and instead shift our attention to the whole patient. Related: Flu cases are on the rise across Australia. Do I need a winter vaccination? When the team commends the pharmacist’s foresight, I am reminded of the days of paper charts when careless handwriting of dangerous drugs like insulin and warfarin could make the difference between life and death . The hospital pharmacists’ tireless pursuit of legible orders saved more than a few nascent careers from being cut short by a fatal error. In the hospital, no day goes by without pharmacists improving patient outcomes. We have different skills but the same goal, to serve the patient, so it has never crossed my mind to think that pharmacists are “less” than doctors. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup When I visit the local pharmacist, I see evidence of a community spirit that has left the hospitals. Good pharmacists know their patients. They know who is cognitively impaired, who has a disabled child, and who needs a nudge to get vaccinated. For regular patients, there is a reassuring familiarity but even for infrequent customers like me, there is demonstrable professionalism and care that instils confidence. Most doctors I know count pharmacists among their trusted colleagues and friends, which is why the latest war of words between the two profession’s lobby groups seems so unedifying. Community pharmacists want a right to limited prescribing, such as antibiotics for uncomplicated urinary tract infections and the contraceptive pill, claiming this will relieve pressure on doctors and allow low-risk patients access to timely treatment when it’s impossible to find a doctor. The scarcity of general practitioners is real. A retired specialist told me that after repeated rejection, he had to write an “application” to his local practice reminding them that he had devoted his career to caring for their patients. If this is the kind of influence required to get a general practitioner, “regular” people have a problem. No one wins when healthcare workers turn on each other. But doctors strongly reject expanding the scope of pharmacists. They say that the success of pilot programs for limited prescribing has been misrepresented and warn about pharmacy overreach as well as a conflict of interest if pharmacists both prescribe and sell medicines. In another argument, doctors want commonly prescribed drugs dispensed as an extended supply of 60 rather than 30 days to promote patient convenience and reduce administrative burden. Patients with stable chronic diseases would benefit while those with fluctuating conditions would receive a limited supply and earlier review. I personally see the value in this because an increasing number of patients attending my specialist clinic request repeat prescriptions for their blood pressure and diabetes “while I am here”; they either have trouble getting to a GP, can’t afford the gap or consider a monthly visit to the GP to renew a script unnecessary. The time I spend generating these scripts detracts from the specific things I need to do for these patients. However, the doctors’ sensible recommendation has been strongly opposed by pharmacists who perceive it as a tit-for-tat move to reduce their income from a dispensing fee, renewing the Pharmacy Guild’s reputation as “the most powerful lobby group you have never heard of”. Meanwhile, the government is striving to get the balance right in an environment where there are no magic solutions. The healthcare crisis is global. The population is ageing, expectations keep rising and funding is finite. Clinicians and policymakers agree that good healthcare means delivering the right care by the right provider in the right setting. Primary care needs urgent resuscitation but it can’t hurt for professionals to give and take in the best interest of the patient. In this febrile atmosphere, the Australian Medical Association recently released a video warning the public that funding pharmacists to go beyond their current remit “will threaten your safety, fragment your care, and undermine Australia’s world-class health system”. This sounds too bad to be true. When rating honesty and integrity, the community consistently puts nurses higher than doctors, who closely mirror pharmacists. There are probably “bad” pharmacists just as there are rogue doctors and unethical nurses, but to tarnish an entire profession is a recipe for inviting ridicule upon oneself. No one doubts the value of doctors. But to underline this, doctors can sometimes get carried away by the refrain that it takes years to train one of us and no other profession comes close. Ask any healthcare worker and they describe an undercurrent of disdain that a nurse is not a doctor, a physiotherapist is not a doctor, a pharmacist is not a doctor. But the public is unmoved by such protestations because it isn’t looking for substitute doctors; people appreciate nurses, paramedics, allied health workers and pharmacists for who they are. Related: Like Medicare, the PBS urgently needs overhauling – for all our sakes | Trent Zimmerman Doctors will never shift public opinion by turning their badge of honour into a chip on the shoulder. But the real reason we should all care about the spat between two powerful lobby groups is that it undermines patient confidence. Patients are right to suspect that the arguments seem largely self-serving and ignore their best interest. Professionals on both sides are discomfited by the disparagement of their colleagues and want the spotlight back on public good. No one wins when healthcare workers turn on each other. Winston Churchill observed that healthy citizens are the greatest asset any country can have. Doctors can’t defend the asset alone. Imagine a world where doctors and pharmacists respected each other and put the patient first. For most of us, that is the real world. Don’t let the lobbyists tell you otherwise.

    "title": "TikTok Australia has launched a factcheck on itself. But does it tell the full story?",
    "author": "Josh Taylor",
    "content": "The Chinese social media app TikTok has been under fire recently. The Australian government announced a ban of the app on government-owned devices earlier this month. The ban has been implemented at a government level in other western countries including the US, the UK, New Zealand, Canada and France. On Monday, TikTok Australia published a self-described factcheck, titled The Truth About TikTok: Separating Fact from Fiction, on TikTok’s site and on LinkedIn. Related: TikTok can still access data from Australian government devices via app on personal phones, academic warns However, the report, Myth vs fact, did not tell the full story. We decided to take a close look at some of the company’s claims. On Chinese ownership The factcheck labels it a “myth” that “TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance Ltd, is Chinese owned”. In an attempt to downplay Chinese ownership, it says roughly 60% of its parent company, ByteDance, is owned by global institutional investors. The remainder is made up of employees across the globe (20%), as well as the company’s founder (20%), who TikTok describes as “a private individual and not part of any state or government entity”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup But this confirms that at least 20% and likely much more of the company is, in fact, Chinese-owned. A submission to Australia’s parliamentary inquiry on foreign influence through social media claimed that the company’s founder, Zhang Yiming, “has links to provincial united front organisations in Fujian”. The CCP’s united front is a Chinese government organisation that works to advance the party’s interests – particularly abroad. TikTok has dismissed the research paper that formed the basis of the submission. On being headquartered in China The factcheck also labelled it a “myth” that “TikTok and ByteDance are headquartered in China”, saying “ByteDance does not have a single global headquarters”. ByteDance is incorporated in the Cayman Islands, but in the company’s appeal against the US official divestment order in 2020, ByteDance repeatedly described itself as a “Chinese-headquartered” company. The ‘manipulation’ of content TikTok claims it does not “[manipulate] content in a way that benefits the Chinese government or harms Australian interests”. The factcheck says the company “does not permit any government to influence or change its recommendation model” and that users can “find a variety of content and views expressed about certain political issues or events, including those which are critical of the Chinese government”. It is difficult to verify these claims because the TikTok algorithm that governs what users see on their “For You” page is secret. After the TikTok chief executive, Shou Zi Chew, appeared before US Congress earlier this year some users reported they began seeing pro-Chew videos in their feed , but TikTok denied the suggestion it was deliberating serving users pro-TikTok content and others said it was more likely a result of the app’s algorithm responding to users having pro-TikTok feelings. On censorship The company claimed it does not censor “TikTok content on behalf of the CCP or Chinese government”. But leaked moderator documents obtained in 2019 by the Guardian revealed TikTok had instructed its moderators to censor videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence, or the banned religious group Falun Gong. TikTok argued at the time that the documents were outdated. National intelligence law TikTok labelled it a “myth” that “under its 2017 National Intelligence law, the Chinese government can compel ByteDance to share Australian TikTok user data”. TikTok claims that Australian TikTok user data is stored in Singapore, Malaysia and the US, and is “subject to local laws”, arguing this would protect the China law being applied outside China. However, a Department of Homeland Security report argues the law can be applied to data held domestically in China or abroad. Data collection At least one of the claims in TikTok’s factcheck is well supported by the available evidence: that the app itself is “not unique in the amount of information it collects”. Social media companies of all stripes collect and share user data, a practice they defend as typical across the industry . As Guardian Australia reported last week, the ban on government employees downloading the TikTok app to their work devices may be rendered ineffective due to these data-sharing practices.",

    "author": "Henry Belot",
    "content": "The Albanese government will spend an extra $4.8bn on aged care in next month’s budget to maintain funding commitments, but the sector has warned it will still not be enough to keep all residential care homes open amid staff shortages. The cost of aged care is expected to rise by 23% next financial year to $29.6bn and become the fifth-largest area of government expenditure. But even with the increase, industry groups say older Australians will increasingly be unable to get care when they need it. Related: State treasurers propose targeting men to work in care sector to boost productivity Surging demand and an ageing population have driven the cost increase; the number of people in aged care has increased to about 1.5 million, growing by 3.5% in two years. That trend will continue, and will cost taxpayers nearly $36bn a year by 2026. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, and the aged care minister, Anika Wells, have accused the former Coalition government of “egregiously underfunding” the sector in its final budget, leaving a multibillion-dollar blackhole. “The Liberals and the Nationals cruelly underfunded our aged care sector – this hurt Australian seniors the most, but it’s also put incredible pressure on the budget,” Chalmers said. “We owe it to our senior citizens to deliver adequate funding for aged care in this country. It’s what Australians expect and what our seniors deserve.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Growing demand has been exacerbated by a shortage of staff willing to work in a historically low-paid sector. Three facilities have announced they will close in recent weeks, citing financial pressure and difficulty meeting the government’s new 24-hour staffing mandate, which takes effect from July. Tom Symondson, the chief executive of the industry peak body Aged and Community Care Providers Association, said the vast majority of facilities were losing an average of $28 for every resident every day. “That is simply not sustainable,” Symondson said. “The aged care sector is facing enormous financial challenges and workforce shortages, at the same time that it is racing to implement the once-in-a-generation reforms emerging from the royal commission … final report two years ago.” A report by the financial analysts StewartBrown found almost two-thirds of aged care providers were operating at a loss in the second half of last year. It called for the federal government to fund a greater share of costs for each aged care resident and to consider tax cuts for nurses that switch to aged care. “To avoid closure of homes and reduced service delivery, especially in regional locations, an emergency funding package also needs to be considered in the short term to ensure current viability and allow for the necessary funding reforms to be properly implemented,” the report said. Related: More aged care facilities to close as Labor defends nurse staffing requirements The federal government has previously disagreed with StewartBrown’s assessments of the aged care industry, as has the the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Union , which believes the financial pressures may be overstated. “We think those figures are not sufficiently transparent enough for us to really assess whether the sector is financially sustainable or not,” Annie Butler, ANMF national secretary, said. “The [StewartBrown] report does not cover all providers and the ANMF’s previous investigations, over the last four to five years, have demonstrated to us there’s a lot of tax avoidance and a lot of structures that obscure what real situation is.” Bupa, one of Australia’s largest aged care providers, said it welcomed the federal government’s commitment to boosting the workforce, but said it would take years to address the shortfall, despite significant investment. “As a sector, we continue to experience severe workforce pressures, especially in regional Australia. Increasingly, this means many older Australians may not be able to access residential care when they need it,” a Bupa spokesperson said.",

On her first day on the job, Price claimed that Aboriginal communities would be “exploited” through the referendum, and said there were some people who falsely “claim to be Indigenous”. \n So who is Price, and how did she vault into shadow cabinet within months of joining federal parliament? \n Who is Jacinta Nampijinpa Price? \n She was born in Darwin in 1981 to parents who met while working as teachers in the Tiwi Islands. Speaking to the former deputy prime minister John Anderson in a video interview in 2018, Price said of her parents: “Mum’s Warlpiri, Dad’s a white fella from Newcastle.” \n Price has often described herself as a “Warlpiri-Celtic woman”. \n Her mother, Bess, was also a politician. Bess Price was elected to the NT assembly between 2012 and 2016 as a member of the Country Liberal party, holding positions as minister for community services, local government and housing. \n Jacinta Price said her family moved to Alice Springs when she was a toddler, where she went to school and had children – her first arriving while she was in year 12. \n “The sorts of things I grew up with, understanding my culture, my family are very traditional,” told Anderson in 2018. “I performed in ceremony as a child, but also understood the parts of culture that aren’t so lovely. \n “I’ve grown up knowing you have to be tough, you have to be physically tough. Women are quite ready to act out violently if need be, when you’re an Aboriginal woman. I’ve grown up seeing a lot of violence in my own family.” \n She said her family members had “perpetrated violence and sexual violence”. \n Price’s LinkedIn profile states she has worked as a “cross cultural consultant” with her family business, Jajirdi Consultants, offering cultural awareness training. She also worked as an executive director of a production company making “Indigenous themed Pre-School Television Shows, Stage Musicals and other projects” and as director of the Indigenous research program at the Centre for Independent Studies, a conservative thinktank, according to the profile. \n Her bio also lists her as a contributor to the Australian newspaper from 2016 and a political commentator for Sky News since 2018. \n In 2012 and 2014 Price uploaded songs to Triple J Unearthed , a publishing platform for independent Australian musicians. The website states that in 2013 she planned to launch her debut album, Dry River, which she described as “a mix of folk, soul and country music that pays tribute to her life growing up in Central Australia”. \n \n Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \n \n “Being part of two cultures Warlpiri and Anglo-Celtic has always influenced the way in which her music has been created,” the website says. “As a youngster she played the violin before her focus switched to voice as part of local hip-hop outfits ‘Flava 4’ and ‘C-Mobs’.” \n In one of the few disclosures on her parliamentary register of interests, Price declared “writer and performance royalties” from Apra, the performers’ rights association. \n From local councillor to senator \n In 2015 Price was elected to the Alice Springs local council before becoming deputy mayor in 2020. She became a regular guest on Sky News and was quoted in News Corp tabloids, drawing attention to violence and alcohol in the NT. \n \n Related: What is the Indigenous voice to parliament, how would it work, and what happens next? \n \n On her website, Price writes: “I’ve been turning the tables on the left for years. \n “Almost two decades ago, I started working in the NT to bridge the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. I’ve been unafraid to call it like it is ever since.” \n In 2019 she ran unsuccessfully as the CLP candidate for the NT seat of Lingiari, defeated by the veteran Labor MP Warren Snowdon 55%-45% on a two-party-preferred basis. But in 2021 she successfully beat the incumbent CLP senator Sam McMahon in a preselection battle and all but assured her election as the NT’s conservative senator. \n This came after McMahon was accused of being drunk in the Senate chamber, just a week before the preselection vote. McMahon denied the allegations, claiming she was unwell, and later quit the CLP to sit as an independent until the 2022 election. \n Price appeared alongside the former prime minister Scott Morrison several times during the election campaign, drawing attention when she described him as “an elder of our country” after protesters attempted to disrupt a Darwin press conference with loudspeakers and sirens. \n She was comfortably elected at the poll and entered parliament in mid-2022. \n In her first speech to parliament she spoke of wanting to support jobs and business in the NT, rather than “the shackles of welfare dependency”. \n Price also criticised what she called “opportunistic Indigenous community politics” and “Indigenous-industry gravy-train consumers”. She described symbolic welcome to country or acknowledgments of country at public events as a “reinvention of culture”, and strongly rejected the proposed Indigenous voice, which she claimed was a “virtue-signalling agenda”. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “I personally have had more than my fill of being symbolically recognised,” she said. \n “I am an empowered Warlpiri Celtic Australian woman who did not need and has never needed a paternalistic government to bestow my own empowerment upon me. We’ve proven for decades now that we do not need a chief protector of Aborigines.” \n A key anti-voice campaigner \n Since entering parliament, Price’s public comments have strongly focused on the referendum, and she has emerged as potentially the most prominent anti-voice campaigner. \n Price was a headline attraction at the 2022 CPAC conference in Sydney, where opposing the voice was a major focus. She described the voice as “racial separatism” . She has been on record since at least 2019 opposing the voice concept, appearing in an Institute of Public Affairs advertisement . \n \n Related: Jacinta Price calls for federal takeover of child protection, claims Indigenous kids being sent back to abusers \n \n She was central at the press conference where the National party announced its opposition to the voice in November 2022, a year before the vote is expected to be held. In a statement at the time, the Nationals leader, David Littleproud, claimed the voice “devalues the 11 elected Indigenous MPs, including Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price”. \n The decision led to strong criticism from various Nationals state branches that backed the voice. \n Price has become a constant travel companion of the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, as he made numerous trips to the NT to campaign against the voice. \n Her profile has ballooned since the election, now operating one of the most followed and popular Facebook pages of any Australian politician. Her 186,000 Facebook followers is equivalent to three-quarters of the entire NT population, and her posts often rank as among the most popular of any politician in the country. \n \n \n With 14281 interactions, Jacinta Nampijinpa Price has had more engagement on this Facebook post than any other politician's post on Apr 04: https://t.co/2GEEMPpa9D (883 comments, 12963 likes and reactions, 435 shares) — auspol_posts (@auspol_posts) April 5, 2023 \n \n \n Price also assumed positions with Fair Australia, the anti-voice campaign from Advance, where she has also operated as a spokesperson. Fair’s website says the campaign is “led by Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price”. \n Previously, Price had been on the committee of Recognise a Better Way, a separate anti-voice organisation led by the Indigenous businessman and former political candidate Warren Mundine. Shortly after the announcement she was joining the body Price quit and said her efforts were better directed to the “grassroots” campaign being run by Fair. \n Mundine and Price have appeared together at press conferences and public events opposing the referendum. Guardian Australia understands the pair intend to tour the country, holding campaign events for the no vote. \n Price, in her first comments after being named shadow minister for Indigenous Australians, claimed the voice is “run by those who have had long-held positions within the Aboriginal industry” and that communities “will be exploited” in the referendum. \n Asked about the South Australian parliament’s newly legislated voice, Price also alluded to flashpoint claims of people falsely claiming Indigenous heritage. \n “I think it is utterly ridiculous that it is being left open for individuals to declare their Aboriginality,” she said. \n “Another matter that is of great concern, which has been talked about by a lot of Indigenous people around the country, are those who claim to be Indigenous who aren’t necessarily Indigenous. You will see in South Australia a dramatic increase in the number of Indigenous people within its population.”",

    "author": "Clea Skopeliti",
    "content": "The UK inflation rate could drop out of double digits for the first time since last summer when the Office for National Statistics releases figures for March on Wednesday, with the headline rate expected to fall back to 9.8% from 10.4% in February. Despite the predicted fall, the headline rate of inflation has been stuck at 40-year highs for months and is well above the Bank of England’s official 2% target. Some products have risen even further in price, leaving consumers with hefty supermarket bills or trying to stock their basket with alternatives. Shoppers across the country singled out the one item they’ve noticed jump the most in price – and explained why they can’t live without it. Bovril, 250g, from Tesco 25.7% price rise: currently £4.40 online , £3.50 in March 2022 “Me and my wife have recently had our first baby, and during the pregnancy we found out that she suffers from a vitamin B deficiency. She is also susceptible to an iron deficiency. Bovril was always a very cheap and instant way to get some much needed vitamin B and iron into our diets. “It’s a scandalous price rise. We didn’t buy any for a little while – we had a mini boycott for a few weeks, but we’re back on it now. “I work outside a lot of the year in all weather and since entering my thirties I really suffer from frequently needing to visit the toilet if I drink more than one tea or coffee, which really isn’t ideal when you may be some distance away from a toilet. As Bovril has none of the caffeine like tea or coffee, the issue doesn’t persist.” Lloyd Farrell, 34, construction manager in Cardiff Unsweetened soya drink from Asda 58.8% price rise: currently £1.35 online , 85p in March 2022 “I don’t drink cows’ milk so non-dairy ones are the only options. Asda oat milk, almond milk and soya milk have all [jumped in price]. It’s shocking. “It is the supermarkets finding another way to profit. I think increases on vegan products is because they think they have a captive audience and can get away with it. “I continue to shop at Asda because it’s within walking distance and I can’t afford petrol at the moment. I try to time my trips down there to time with the reduced section – sometimes I get lucky and fill my freezer.” Marion, 54, small business owner in Merseyside Heineken 0.0 alcohol free lager 12x330ml from Sainsbury’s 37.5% price rise: currently £11 online, £8 in March 2022 “I suppose it isn’t essential, but I credit this product with removing a huge amount of alcohol from my diet. Since lockdown I definitely noticed my alcohol intake had gone up, and over the last year I’ve phased out drinking alcoholic beer at home. “Heineken was the most affordable non-alcoholic lager (and the most palatable). I will still buy it but the increase is a shock – [some] alcoholic beers are available for less. “When I noticed this beer had gone up, that made me feel a bit upset really. There’s not really [many] alternatives – there are lots of very expensive non-alcoholic beers, the Heineken is normally a good budget option.” Jared, 42, filmmaker in Kent Catsan non-clumping odour control cat litter (10l) from Tesco 28.6% price rise: currently £9 online , £7 in March 2022 “I used to buy it from the supermarket as it was comparable across all the major players, but now I buy it in bulk from the internet. “My cats are very fussy and will only use Catsan cat litter. We have tried every other type of litter and every other brand but they will not use it if it’s not Catsan. They prefer to pee on the floor if it’s not up to their exacting standards.” Sinead Garry, 47, charity worker in Shipley Nescafe Gold cappuccino instant coffee 8xsachets 33.3% price rise: currently £2 (on offer) online , £1.50 in March 2022 “I have stopped drinking and smoking so my coffee is the one treat that I rely on to get through the day. Nescafe Gold is the one thing every week that I treat myself to. “You could just get an ordinary cheap coffee but I get it because I’ve sacrificed other things and I’m sticking with it. I’m quite happy to pay a price that’s a bit more expensive but then when I see how much it’s increased, it’s taking the mick. “I shop around but the cheapest I can find when it’s on offer is £2. I shop at Morrisons and Asda and they change the price regularly.” Christine Mulcahy, 61, retired in Bradford Olive oil extra virgin (2l) from Sainsbury’s 36.8% price rise: currently £11.90 online , £8.70 in March 2022 “When the inflation figures go up by something like 10 or 11%, you think: what does that really mean? And then go to the supermarket and you go, oh, this really has gone up. For example, we use olive oil daily in cooking and salads and it’s gone up more than £3, since last year. “When shopping we’ve started asking ourselves, how much is that? Do we really need that? We make sure we buy things that will last for more than one day. My wife recently cooked some potatoes, and instead of doing a few, she did a whole tray and that will last three or four days – which economically is worth doing. That’s the way we look at it now.” Bill Lovatt, retired, Shrewsbury",

    "title": "Chinese-Australians face fewer racist insults than at height of diplomatic tensions with Beijing, survey finds",
    "author": "Daniel Hurst Foreign affairs and defence correspondent",
    "content": "Chinese-Australians have continued to experience racist insults but at a lower rate than when diplomatic tensions between Canberra and Beijing erupted in 2020, a new study has found. Polling commissioned by the Lowy Institute indicates one in five Chinese-Australians said they were called offensive names because of their heritage in 2022. But this figure of 21% was four points lower than the result in the same survey in 2021, and down 10 points from 31% in 2020 , when the diplomatic rift between the Chinese and Australian governments was most stark. Related: Penny Wong and Paul Keating spar as minister warns against ‘frenzied’ Taiwan war speculation Despite cases of hurtful innuendo about alleged divided loyalties, 92% of Chinese-Australian respondents said they regarded Australia as a “very good” or “good” place to live. That figure represents a jump of 15 points since 2020, when the Lowy Institute began an annual poll to gauge how Chinese-Australians saw Australia and their place in it. The director of the Lowy Institute’s multiculturalism, identity and influence project, Jennifer Hsu, said the way politicians and the media conducted the debate about Australia’s relationship with China mattered. “The intersection of Covid-19, including lockdown and debate around its origins, and the broader discussion about China in Australia have had a material impact on Chinese Australians, as seen in the first and second survey around issues on discrimination,” Hsu said. She said the ending of lockdown and the Labor government’s attempt to lower the rhetoric on China gave context to the numbers. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The findings are outlined in a report released on Wednesday titled Being Chinese in Australia: Public opinion in Chinese communities. Australia is home to 1.4 million people with Chinese ancestry, or 5.5% of the population. “Understanding the views of such a significant, longstanding community is a worthwhile endeavour. But it is even more important at a time when the effects of growing geopolitical competition are being felt in Australia,” the report said. “Grasping the impact that these and other issues are having on how Chinese-Australians see their place in Australian society is critical, therefore, not least to the country’s social cohesion.” The findings are based on a national survey of 1,200 adults in Australia who identify as of Chinese heritage and was conducted by the Social Research Centre between 27 September and 10 December 2022. Weights were applied to the sample design using Australian Bureau of Statistics census benchmarks with a margin of error of 3%. Participants could choose whether to complete the questionnaire in English, Simplified Chinese or Traditional Chinese. “Most Chinese-Australians have a positive view of Australia,” the report said. “A majority say that Australia is a good place to live and are proud of the Australian way of life and culture. Three-quarters say they feel a moderate or strong sense of belonging – an increase from the 2021 survey.” The respondents were asked how much confidence they had in each of 12 leaders “to do the right thing regarding world affairs”. Six in 10 respondents (60%) had “a lot” or “some” confidence in the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, compared with 25% for the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, in a sign the Coalition has a long way to go to win back Chinese-Australian voters. A total of 49% expressed confidence in Jacinda Ardern, the New Zealand prime minister at the time of the survey, 42% for the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, and 32% for Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen. “Almost half of Chinese-Australians say that democracy is preferable to any other kind of government, an increase of 14 points since 2021,” the report said. Those surveyed were split on whether Aukus, the security partnership with the UK and US, would make Australia more or less safe or make no difference. Of the Chinese-Australians surveyed, 27% said Aukus would make Australia more safe, 26% less safe and 26% no difference. The report said a majority of Chinese-Australians used WeChat for their English and Chinese-language news but usage of the app had declined since 2021.",

    "title": "Help! Should Australians rush to pay down student loans before indexation?",
    "author": "Katie Cunningham",
    "content": "In 2018, arts worker Sarah began paying off her student loan debt of $31,330. She didn’t think too much about it until this year, when she logged on to her MyGov account to check the balance – and saw it had only gone down to $30,630.59. Despite having paid $5,721 from her salary over the past five years, she has only managed to knock off $799.41. \n “It was the first time I realised that despite all this money coming out of my salary, I had barely made a dent,” Sarah, who asked that only her first name be used, says. “It was just a shock there, because I feel like we were very much sold it as a ‘no interest loan’.” \n While they are interest free, loans from the Higher Education Loan Program (Help) – previously the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (Hecs) – are subject to indexation, which adjusts debts each year in line with inflation. For the past 10 years, the indexation rate has always hovered about 2% – still enough to make paying off your loan a slow-going endeavour and downright sisyphean for those earning under $60,000 a year. \n \n Related: These coffees show why men have more cash in superannuation than women \n \n Now current inflation levels mean that this year’s increase, which will be announced on 26 April, is projected to land at about 7%. That means Australians with an average Help debt of $24,770.75 are poised to see their balance increase by at least $1,700 when the indexation comes into effect on 1 June. And that’s after Australians experienced the largest real wage decline on record in 2022. \n For Sarah, despite what she’s already paid towards the debt, after indexation, her loan balance will be higher this year than it was when she finished university. That’s a bitter pill to swallow. \n “I took that Hecs debt out knowing that I would pay it back later and I thought that was a fair system,” Sarah says. “But should [the government] really be making that extra money on the education system? I don’t know that’s what we agreed to.” \n If you’re one of the many Australians who, like Sarah, will soon watch your Help debt go up, should you be trying to proactively pay it off faster? \n The answer will of course vary hugely based on your individual circumstances, but here is some general advice to keep in mind. \n Should I be worried about my Help debt? \n If your financial education came from a copy of the Barefoot Investor in the early 2010s, you may remember reading that Help is a “good” debt to have – and not one you need to rush to pay off. But given the current economic climate, does that advice still hold true? \n “I think it depends on if you believe inflation will get under control and indexation will come back down to a reasonable level – around that 2 to 3% mark,” says Rocky Johnston, a financial planner with Prosperity Wealth Advisors. \n Johnston believes we’re likely looking at big indexation rates this year and next. Then, “if the government does their job”, inflation should ease, as will the annual upward adjustments of indexation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Everyone’s situation is different, Johnston says. But broadly speaking, even if you have enough in savings to pay down your Help debt before the indexation date, in most cases he would probably still advise clients to leave their Help debt as is. \n \n Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning \n \n Even though the forecasted 7% indexation rate is a lot higher than the 3-5% you might be earning in interest on your savings balance, Johnston believes it is better to “take the hit” this year and next and continue to pay Help debt off slowly. \n That’s because Australians with Help debts are typically young people, who are likely better off using any spare money for other goals. “Whether it be putting money in your super , investing, or buying that first home, which over the long run might provide a [greater] benefit to your life than just trying to save an extra $1000 by paying off your Hecs a little bit earlier.” \n Johnston also points out that when you make extra repayments towards your Help debt, you can’t get them back – there’s no redraw facility. This means you have to be very sure you won’t need that money for something more pressing. \n But what if I want to buy a home or have a baby? \n There are some situations in which it might make sense to consider paying down your debt before the indexation date, Johnston says. \n If you are due to pay off your Help balance in the next two years anyway, it is worth considering, he says. In that case getting rid of the last of your debt now might save you between a few hundred to a couple of thousand dollars, depending on your income. \n Help debts do affect how much a bank is willing to lend you for a mortgage, because they lower your take-home pay. This means if you’re close to applying for a home loan, you should run the numbers with a mortgage broker to determine whether you’d be in a better position if you paid off any Help debt now, or kept that extra cash for your deposit. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A planned career break is the final reason it may make sense to get rid of your Help debt faster. \n “What happens if you take a break away from the workforce to have children, or go down to part-time work and you no longer have to make repayments?” says Canna Campbell, a financial planner and author, who is a big advocate for provocatively paying down your Help debt – after more “toxic debt” from credit cards or personal loans has been tackled first. \n \n Related: Australia’s soaring interest rates have trapped ‘mortgage prisoners’ into crushing repayments \n \n “This is where things really blow out for women,” she says. \n “While they’re not working or not making repayments, that debt gets bigger and bigger and bigger [because of indexation]. And people return to the workforce to … discover their Hecs debt has compounded and gotten slightly out of control.” \n Finally, there is the harder-to-quantify emotional incentive for getting rid of debt: it alleviates the frustration of seeing your wages garnisheed. “I’ve never met someone that said to me, I regret paying off my Hecs debt,” says Campbell. \n Remember: the rules could change \n The government dictates the terms of your Help debt. For instance the previous federal government significantly lowered the salary at which you must start making repayments. Campbell believes the terms around our student loans could change again – even swapping from an indexation rate to an interest rate. \n From 2016 through to today, Help debt holders would have been in a better position if they had been charged interest at the cash rate, rather than having their loans indexed. So the potential for change doesn’t mean you should act fast – waiting things out might prove advantageous. \n The Greens are currently pushing for a bill that would essentially freeze Help indexation this year. “It doesn’t look like it’s overly likely to happen,” Johnston says, but such legislation could always be introduced in the future. \n If you are considering paying off your Help debt before the indexation date, Johnston suggests waiting a few more weeks, to see what happens in the May budget, just in case the Greens do succeed. \n But be aware that, confusingly, Help debts index on 1 June, not 1 July. Johnston advises making any payment in mid-May, to ensure the ATO gets it in time. \n And while it may seem a little morbid, there’s one final point to keep in mind. \n “A lot of people don’t know this, but [Help] actually dies with you,” Johnston says. “I know it’s a little bit grim to discuss but it’s worth considering that it’s the only type of loan that’s forgiven if you were to pass away.” So there’s always that.",

    "title": "UK inflation expected to dip below 10% as energy prices fall",
    "author": "Larry Elliott Economics editor",
    "content": "Britain’s annual inflation rate is poised to fall below 10% for the first time since last August when the latest official figures for the cost of living are released on Wednesday. A sharp fall in energy prices is thought likely to have dragged down the government’s preferred measure of inflation from 10.4% in February to 9.8% in March, according to a poll of economists conducted by Reuters. The Bank of England, which is responsible for hitting the official 2% inflation target, believes there will be further falls over the coming months as the impact fades of last year’s invasion of Ukraine by Russia. The consumer prices index rose by 1.1% in March alone last year, followed by a further 2.5% increase in April, but the price of gas on global wholesale markets is now lower than it was before the war began on 24 February 2022. Threadneedle Street interest-rate setters on the Bank’s monetary policy committee are, however, concerned that core inflation – which excludes items such as food and energy – will prove harder to bring down than the headline rate. While MPC members do not have a target for core inflation, they see it as a proxy for price pressures generated by the domestic economy. On this measure, the annual cost of living rose from 5.8% to 6.2% in March. Headline inflation was expected to drop below 10% when the February figures were released last month but instead rose from 10.1% to 10.4% as a result of the biggest increase in food prices in 45 years. Interactive The former MPC member Andrew Sentance said on Tuesday the Bank was itself partly responsible for double-digit inflation by continuing with its money creation programme – quantitative easing – for too long. He told MPs on the Treasury committee: “We had this long period of extremely low interest rates and further injections of QE after the immediate problems and the financial crisis have passed. That all, I think, has contributed over a period of time to the inflationary pressures that we’re now seeing.” Even if the economists’ prediction proves accurate, UK inflation will remain markedly higher than in the US and the eurozone, where it currently stands at 5% and 6.9% respectively.",

    "title": "World’s at-risk kelp forests provide billions of dollars in benefits, study shows",
    "author": "Graham Readfearn",
    "content": "Almost a third of the globe’s coastal environments rely on kelp to reduce local pollution and sustain fisheries that provide billions of dollars in benefits, according to a new study. But the climate crisis, overfishing, invasions of voracious sea urchins and pollution are putting at risk the world’s kelp forests, threatening the economic benefits they provide and the huge array of species they support. Related: The dead sea: Tasmania’s underwater forests disappearing in our lifetime “They are the forests of the sea,” said Dr Aaron Eger, the study’s lead author. “If we lose these kelp forests, then we lose the oceans as we know it across massive regions all over the globe.” About 740 million people around the world live within 50km (30 miles) of kelp-dominated marine environments, the study published in Nature Communications said. But the critical role kelp plays in absorbing nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon, and keeping coastal environments healthy had gone underappreciated and understudied, said Eger, a marine ecologist at the University of New South Wales. He led the study alongside 18 other researchers from 10 countries to examine how six common types of kelp provided so-called “services” that benefit societies. They calculated the amount of nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon dioxide being absorbed by kelp forests worldwide and monetary values for each – the first time a global assessment of the value of kelp forests has been attempted. The world’s kelp forests absorb excess nitrogen and phosphorus running in to oceans from the land, and were likely absorbing the equivalent of about 18m tonnes of CO2 every year. Kelp also offers the building blocks for fisheries of abalone, lobsters and reef fish. Every hectare of kelp forest provides habitat for an average of about 900kg of harvested fish and seafood annually, the study says. Eger said when nitrogen washed into oceans from activities on the land, such as farming and industry, this could promote the rapid growth of microscopic algae that, when it died, depleted the waters of oxygen. But the world’s kelp forests were absorbing vast amounts of nitrogen which, in turn, improved water quality and gave marine life habitats to live. “This is just a baseline study, so we expect the approximations will get more accurate as the field advances,” Eger said. “There were also many other services we didn’t assess, including tourism, educational and learning experiences, and kelp as a source of food, so we anticipate the actual value of kelp forests in the world to be higher.” In some areas, including northern Tasmania, Western Australia and northern California, losses of up to 95% of kelp have been recorded. Eger said often the underlying cause of kelp losses was marine heatwaves that killed it off, but overfishing that removed the natural predators of urchins that eat through the forests also contributed. Last month a study found more than 500 Australian reef species had declined in number over the past decade, with many of the losses concentrated along the kelp-dominated rocky reefs in the continent’s southern waters. Related: Scientists discover pristine deep-sea Galápagos reef ‘teeming with life’ “They are taking it from all fronts, but leading those is temperature,” Eger said. “In most places, we’re looking at slow or precipitous declines of kelp forests. “The kelp is what’s holding everything together and, if you pull at it like a thread, then you unweave the whole tapestry.” Eger is the founder of the Kelp Forest Alliance – a not-for-profit group trying to raise awareness of the role of kelp and encourage voluntary pledges for conservation projects around the globe. He said some steps being taken included the physical removal of urchins, improvements in controlling pollution and the replanting of kelp that, under the right conditions, could grow rapidly.",

    "title": "UK imposes sanctions on art collector accused of financing Hezbollah",
    "author": "Daniel Boffey Chief reporter",
    "content": "A high-profile art collector has been put on a Treasury sanctions list and charged in the US over claims that he uses his collection, which has included masterpieces by Pablo Picasso, Antony Gormley and Andy Warhol, to launder money for the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. Nazem Ahmad, a diamond and art dealer who once posed in his Beirut penthouse for a glossy magazine and featured in a piece about the “world’s most beautiful homes and the fascinating people who live in them”, has been targeted in the UK under new counter-terrorism powers. He had previously been put on a sanctions list by the US Treasury, and on Tuesday, a New York court charged him, along with eight co-defendants including his son and daughter, of defying those prohibitions by completing art and jewel transactions worth $160m since 2019. An unnamed suspect was arrested in the UK as part of the US investigation. Ahmad, who has not yet been located, did not respond to a request for comment when approached by this newspaper via his gallery in Beirut or on social media. In the UK Treasury’s announcement of sanctions, Ahmad had been described as a suspected financier of Hezbollah, a Shia Muslim political movement backed by Iran and which the UK government classified in its entirety as a terrorist group in 2019. According to the Treasury, Ahmad, who has 172,000 Instagram followers, has a large art collection in the UK and is well known in the British art community, where he is said to have worked with “multiple UK-based artists, art galleries and auction houses”. All of Ahmad’s assets in the UK, including what has been described as an “extensive art collection”, have now been frozen, the Treasury said, and British artists, galleries and auction houses have been prohibited from trading with him or six named companies, including his Artual gallery in Beirut, which is run by his daughter, Hind Nazem Ahmad. The Treasury minister in the House of Lords, Joanna Penn, said: “We will always proactively defend our economy against those who seek to abuse it. The firm action we have taken today will clamp down on those who are funding international terrorism, strengthening the UK’s economic and national security.” Ahmad is accused of using art to shelter and launder money for the purposes of terrorism. The use of art, a sector that historically tends towards discretion and the protection of privacy, for the purpose of laundering involves the buying and selling of high-valued pieces to disguise the origins of illegally obtained funds. Pieces can be relatively easily sold across national borders without alerting the authorities. The subjective nature of the value of art allows prices to be easily inflated or deflated. The antiquities, art and cultural object market is said to have had a global value of $65.1bn in 2021, according to the Financial Action Task Force, an intergovernmental laundering watchdog that issued a report in February to advise on regulatory best practice. Five years ago, Ahmad featured in articles in the Architectural Digest Middle East and the Selections Art magazine. It was claimed his collection included works by Jean-Michel Basquiat, Ai Weiwei, Thomas Heatherwick and Marc Quinn, among others. During an interview, Ahmad also spoke of his first art purchase, which he described as a work on paper by Picasso, bought in the early 1990s. In 2019, the US Treasury had imposed sanctions against Ahmad and two others, describing him as the personal financier to the Hezbollah secretary general, Hassan Nasrallah. Ahmad had been considered a “major Hezbollah financial donor” since 2016, they said. According to a nine-count indictment unsealed on Tuesday in the US district court for the eastern district of New York, Ahmad and his co-defendants had defied those sanction and had since 2019 “relied on a complex web of business entities to obtain valuable artwork from US artists and art galleries and to secure US-based diamond-grading services, all while hiding Ahmad’s involvement”. In a statement, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) said Ahmad had commissioned works and negotiated their sale all while insisting that his connection was kept from public view. “Approximately $160m worth of artwork and diamond-grading services were transacted through the US financial system,” the DoJ said. “One defendant was arrested today in the United Kingdom at the request of the United States, and the eight remaining defendants, including Ahmad, are believed to reside outside the United States and remain at large.” Ahmad has previously denied reports that he was linked to financing Hezbollah.",

    "author": "Rob Smyth",
    "content": "THE HAND OF TODD Football Daily has spent the last few days enjoying a right good laugh at the expense of Chelsea co-owner Todd D’oh!ly. Yes, he’s sitting on $5.3bn, which is about £500, and we’re wrestling with the big questions of 2023 (bread or spread?). But just look at the state of this philanthropic multi-billionaire! As Chelsea prepare for a season-defining Big Cup match against Real Madrid, most of the talk is not of the players, or Frank Lampard’s win percentage in his second spell as manager, or even his draw percentage. It’s D’oh!ly, whose dressing-room pep talk after the defeat by Brighton on Saturday has leaked faster than b@nterous first-leg predictions from his overenthusiastic mouth. D’oh!ly reportedly called Chelsea’s season “embarrassing”, after which, according to the National Grid, there was a surge in pot/kettle analogies, and singled out one player – bought for big money in the last 12 months, and yes this stuff does write itself – for criticism. In the bowels of Stamford Bridge, it seems, there isn’t much looking glass. D’oh!ly’s combination of enthusiasm, power and ignorance are in danger of setting USA! USA!! USA!!!-UK football relations back 20 years, and they weren’t exactly thriving before he invited Jesse Marsch to hold his watery beer. In Monday’s pre-match press conference, Lampard and Kepa Arrizabalaga did their best to pretend this was perfectly normal, but nobody was fooling anybody. “When an owner is invested in their interest in the team and wants to help and improve, it’s their prerogative to have the input they want,” tooted Lampard. “I remember the moments as a player of owners first coming into the dressing room. It first happened at Chelsea. I remember being really happy that they were there,” he continued, as all across London, in unison, polygraph machines went up in flames. “You could touch them, you could high-five them and listen to them and feel them. That’s not a bad thing in terms of the identity of the club and where you want to get to.” In Chelsea’s case, that’s August 2023, hence their surprise £100m bid to buy Benjamin Harvey Bailey Smith. They are a billion-dollar shambles who can’t wait for the season to end. A total farce. Hahahaha, Roflol. Well, yes, probably. But schadenfreude, like onanism, is an indulgence that should only be savoured when you are 100% sure it won’t rebound in your face. Chelsea were arguably in an even bigger mess when they first won Big Cup in 2012, and Thomas Tuchel didn’t exactly inherit a self-driving dressing-room in 2021 either. Indeed, when Chelsea and Big Cup get together, weird things happen: special ones hide in laundry baskets, Norwegian referees fail to give 49 clear penalties against Barcelona in one match, Wayne Bridges topple Invincibles. It’s only a year ago, after all, that Chelsea began a quarter-final second leg against Real Madrid two goals down and produced a comeback for the ages by scoring the next three goals. Yeah, OK, they didn’t see it through and eventually went out in extra time, but that’s got absolutely nothing to do with the narrative we’re peddling here! So while can you never be sure in football, or indeed any other aspect of human life, all logic says Chelsea will lose again. If Football Daily was worth $5.3bn, which is about £500, we’d put a fair whack on it. But one thing is for sure: if Chelsea do go out, remember to celebrate the birthday of the following, all born on this day: Divock Origi, Wojciech Szczesny, Donny van de Beek, Lukasz Fabianski, Matthew Upson, Denzel Dumfries, Maurice Edu, Oumar Niasse, Ben Brereton, Ben Brereton Díaz, Stefan Schwarz, Paul Jones, Arturo Di Napoli and Danny Guthrie. Sing Happy Birthday twice to each of them, because that’s how long it will take Lampard to meticulously wash his hands of the result in his post-match interview. It’s an old trick of his, tried and tested. This time, he’s probably well within his rights. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Daniel Gallan from 8pm BST for hot MBM coverage of Chelsea 1-2 Real Madrid (agg: 1-4), while Rob Smyth will be on deck for Napoli 2-0 Milan (agg: 2-1). QUOTE OF THE DAY “I don’t remember ever conceding so many goals in two games in my entire career but I am here to give my best to try and help the team and the club. At this moment I don’t have an explanation for what’s happened. We’re losing composure. It’s hard to accept” – Javi Gracia struggles to explain his team’s latest defensive capitulation as Leeds continue to milk the benefits of sacking Marcelo Bielsa, with a 6-1 home shoeing by Liverpool leaving them dangling precariously above the Premier League trap door. FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS So, Todd Boehly chats to the players after every game. Perhaps he could spare a minute to chat to us Chelsea fans – we’d love to hear the thinking behind buying an unmanageably large squad, but no one to score a goal, and having more managers in a season than Roman Abramovich could have dreamed of” – Mike Davis. After the weekend’s usual video-based officiating shenanigans, my son and I have decided to tentatively punt a better alternative. Rather than referring to a bunch of people in a shed, we humbly suggest referring to an ordinary football-watching person on a sofa with their Tin – arguably a better-versed authority – for a decision following several replays. It, of course would be known as BAR” – Peter Logan. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com . Today’s winner of our prizeless letter o’ the day is … Mike Davis .

    "title": "Conor Benn comeback thrown into doubt as provisional Ukad suspension revealed",
    "author": "Donald McRae",
    "content": "The Conor Benn saga intensified on Tuesday with confirmation that the boxer has been provisionally suspended by UK Anti-Doping since 15 March. \n This ruling has serious ramifications for any British boxing licence holder – including promoters, managers, trainers and other fighters – who had been planning to be involved in Benn’s next bout outside the UK. The latest twist in this long-running story, which was confirmed by Matt Christie , the widely respected editor of Boxing News, is another roadblock to Benn’s planned comeback abroad. \n Last year Benn tested positive twice for clomifene, a substance which can boost testosterone levels by 50%, and he has yet to clear his name in public. Ukad adheres to the rules of the World Anti-Doping Agency code which states, in regard to anyone who facilitates competition for a provisionally suspended athlete: “Where an athlete support person or other person assists a person in violating the prohibition against participation during ineligibility or a provisional suspension, an anti-doping organization with authority over such athlete support person or other person shall impose sanctions for a violation.” \n The British Boxing Board of Control follows Ukad regulations in all anti‑doping matters and complies with the Wada code. This means it would be expected to sanction any licence holder who organises, authorises or participates in any event featuring Benn as he is now provisionally suspended. \n \n \n \n \n \n Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'. \n If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version. \n In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications. \n Turn on sport notifications. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Benn vehemently denies intentionally taking a prohibited substance . He also insists a 270-page report produced by his team provides scientific proof which clears him. But, so far, that document has been shared only with the World Boxing Council, the sanctioning body which ranks him in its list of top 10 welterweights. \n The WBC said there was no conclusive evidence that the 26‑year‑old boxer had deliberately taken a banned drug, but disagreed with him, and the contents of the report, as to the reasons for the presence of clomifene in his system on two separate occasions. \n It is understood that Ukad and the British board had made repeated requests to see the report. Should Benn wish to have his Ukad suspension lifted he would need to address the unresolved issues in the UK and have his case heard by the National Anti-Doping Panel. \n Benn’s trainers and his promoters, Eddie Hearn’s Matchroom Boxing, could be subject to the threatened loss of their British licences should they press ahead with plans for his return to the ring in the Middle East or elsewhere. It also means fighters such as Chris Eubank Jr and the currently retired Kell Brook, who had been touted as possible opponents for Benn in Abu Dhabi on a suggested date of 3 June, could lose their British licence. \n Ukad’s position is that, according to article 10.14.1 of its regulations: “While serving a period of ineligibility or provisional suspension, an athlete or other person may not participate in any capacity (or assist any athlete participating in any capacity) in a competition, event or other activity (other than authorised anti‑doping education or rehabilitation programmes) organised, convened, authorised or recognised by (a) the NGB [national governing body] or by any body that is a member of, or affiliated to, or licensed by the NGB; (b) any signatory; (c) any club or other body that is a member of, or affiliated to, or licensed by, a signatory or a signatory’s member organisation; (d) any professional league or any international- or national-level Event organisation; or (e) any elite or national-level sporting activity funded by a governmental agency.” \n Benn relinquished his British boxing licence last October, after he confirmed he had returned a second positive test result, and so he is free to apply for a licence elsewhere. Attempts to gain a boxing licence in the US, the preferred choice of Benn and Hearn, have so far been unsuccessful. While boxing commissions in the Middle East are expected to be more lenient, the Ukad suspension cannot be ignored. \n Benn’s legal adviser, Mike Morgan, and Hearn declined to comment when Boxing News approached them to confirm Ukad’s provisional suspension.",

    "title": "UK unemployment rises as pay growth lags behind high inflation",
    "author": "Richard Partington Economics correspondent",
    "content": "The UK’s unemployment rate has edged higher and pay growth continues to lag well behind high inflation, according to the latest official data highlighting the dilemma faced by the Bank of England. Reflecting softer conditions in the jobs market as Britain’s economy struggles for growth momentum, the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 3.8% from 3.7%, the Office for National Statistics figures showed. The number of job vacancies also fell for a ninth consecutive month, although it remained high at more than 1.1m as companies struggle to recruit staff. The Office for National Statistics said annual growth in average pay, excluding bonuses, held steady at 6.6% in the three months to February despite a small rise in unemployment and decline in the number of job vacancies. Fuelled by bumper pay for bankers and accountants in the City of London, wage growth including bonuses rose by 5.9%. Economists had forecast weaker rates of pay growth, in a potential dilemma for the Bank of England as it considers whether to raise interest rates for a 12th consecutive time in May. Related: China’s economic growth beats forecasts; UK jobless rate rises to 3.8% – business live However, the ONS said total pay fell by 4.1% on the year after taking inflation into account – among the largest falls since 2009. Official figures for March are expected to show on Wednesday that headline inflation fell to 9.8% from 10.4% in February. However, that would still leave the cost of living well above the Bank’s 2% target, and well ahead of wage growth. Interactive The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said: “While unemployment remains close to historic lows, rising prices continue to eat into pay cheques which is why halving inflation this year is one of our top economic priorities.” The latest snapshot showed a rise in the number of working days lost to strikes in February amid action by civil service staff and teachers, with 348,000 working days lost during the month. Average wage growth in the public sector picked up to 5.3% on the year, the fastest annual rate since 2005, contributing to the narrowest gap with the private sector since 2021. Pay in the public sector had fallen behind by the most on record. Private sector wage growth slowed for a third consecutive month to 6.9%, still significantly ahead of the public sector. Interactive Paul Nowak, the TUC general secretary, said the figures showed workers were suffering the longest wages slump in modern history. Calling on ministers to resolve pay disputes, he said: “Hard-pressed families can’t take much more. It is no surprise that workers are having to take strike action to defend their living standards.” In a mixed update from the jobs market, the latest figures showed an increase in the size of the workforce as more young people left full-time education to find a job, helping to cut the UK’s rate of economic inactivity – when working-age adults are neither in a job or looking for one – by 0.4 percentage points. Britain has lagged behind almost every other advanced economy in the world for increasing workforce participation since the Covid pandemic, making it one of the government’s top priorities as companies struggle to recruit staff. However, long-term sickness rose to a fresh record high of 2.7 million among those still economically inactive, continuing an increase since the Covid pandemic that some economists have attributed to record NHS waiting lists and years of public sector funding cuts. Economists said stronger than expected pay growth, before inflation was taken into account, could add pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates from the current level of 4.25% when its monetary policy committee next meets on 11 May. The central bank is closely watching pay growth amid concerns that a tight jobs market could fuel persistently high levels of inflation. Official inflation figures for March, due to be published on Wednesday, are expected to show the annual rate cooling to below 10% for the first time in six months. Ashley Webb, a UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said: “The labour market became a bit less tight in February and wage growth continued to ease, albeit slowly. “That leaves the Bank of England with a tough call on whether to raise interest rates further.”",

    "title": "Sunak’s wealth isn’t an image problem for voters – except when he refuses to talk about it | Rafael Behr",
    "author": "Rafael Behr",
    "content": "People don’t generally go into British politics for the money, although the money isn’t bad. The basic annual MP’s salary of £84,144 is more than double the UK average. Ministers earn even more. But there are quicker ways to get rich. There are careers where greed can go naked. In politics it has to skulk in itchy robes of public service. Bankers and hedge fund managers don’t need to explain what principle called them to global finance. When Rishi Sunak did those jobs, I doubt he was ever asked why. By the time he switched to politics, he had earned heaps of cash and married Akshata Murthy, the daughter of a billionaire. Cupidity was not the reason he sought office. Likewise, the prime minister’s failure to declare a conflict of interest over government childcare subsidies probably doesn’t expose venal machination. Only in the flickering bunker light of internet conspiracy theory does it look like a devious diversion of budget resources. Carelessness is the plausible explanation. But it is the cultivated carelessness of an unusually rich politician who is desperate to look normal. Sunak has a reputation in government for nerdy attention to detail. It would be surprising if he forgot that his wife owns shares in a company that trains childminders, or that this company stands to benefit from new government childcare subsidies, when discussing the policy with a parliamentary committee. The prime minister was asked if he had anything to declare. He said no, adding that his interests were declared “ in the usual way ”. Downing Street says the spousal connection was recorded in the register of ministerial interests, which hasn’t been published. The MPs’ code of conduct asks members to be “always frank and open” about such matters, which suggests Sunak should have flagged it to the committee. The parliamentary standards commissioner is investigating, which is embarrassing for a prime minister whose first pledge on taking office was to govern with “integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level”. It isn’t much of a challenge to govern more competently than Liz Truss and break fewer rules than Boris Johnson. Sunak paid a fine for attending one of the illegal Downing Street parties during lockdown, but something about his geeky persona meant the smell of reckless wrongdoing didn’t stick. It was the same when he was busted for not wearing a seatbelt in a moving car. Sunak’s uptight manner suggests the kind of person who is mostly fastidious in buckling up. So the prime minister is not in danger of being reviled as a reprobate. His brand can still be tarnished by hypocrisy. It doesn’t help that his efforts to sound authoritative come across as preachy and his blokeish affectations for the campaign trail are cringemaking. That is where the money could get awkward, not as a question of probity but authenticity. Wealth is no obstacle to electoral success in Britain. Labour kept wanting David Cameron’s poshness to be a problem for him and it never was, despite austerity, despite shrinking real wages and rising energy bills. Cameron was accused of being out of touch. Opinion polls proved the charge was resonating with voters all the way up to the 2015 election, when the Tories won a majority. Since then, the cost of living crisis has got much worse, and the Tories have driven the economy into a ditch. But there has been collateral damage to the whole of Westminster, regardless of party affiliation. Voters may doubt that Sunak feels their pain from the comfort of his swimming pool , but they also don’t want lectures on the subject from Labour. And, to the perennial frustration of the left, plenty of people see “millionaire” as a badge of success, a desirable status, not an insult or a target for expropriation. But they still think dues should be paid, which is why Labour’s attack on the Sunak family finances focuses on the non-domicile status that Murthy enjoyed while her husband, as chancellor, was scrapping revenue from everyone else. The most revealing feature of that story when it broke was Sunak’s tin-eared response. He was reluctant to engage with questions. When pressed, he turned prickly and self-righteous, as though his wife’s honour and not his judgment were the object of scrutiny. It was around the same time that Sunak was filmed failing to operate a contactless card payment device. It was part of a bungled publicity stunt in which he put petrol in a mid-range car that turned out to be borrowed for the purpose, because it was humbler than any vehicle in his personal fleet. These are the sorts of details that stick in voters’ minds. They can make the difference between casual acceptance that a prime minister is rich – aren’t they always? – and the suspicion that he lives far away on Planet Money, squinting down on the little people below scurrying around trying to make ends meet in their dinky cars, with their insufficient maths qualifications. Related: Sunak needn’t worry – maths mania already has our schools in a stranglehold | Simon Jenkins The investigation into whether Sunak should have declared a conflict of interest to parliament is not going to reveal anything we don’t already know about the prime minister. Nor, I suspect, will it suddenly shift opinions about him. Labour can’t make too big a thing of it, not least because last year Keir Starmer had to apologise for failing to update his entry in the MPs’ register of interests. But the episode points to an insecurity in the Conservative leader: not his fortune, but his resentment of the way it defines him. Sunak isn’t in politics for the money, but it isn’t obvious what drives him instead. He launched his first leadership bid last summer with a personal film about family and opportunity, making a parable of his immigrant background. When that didn’t win the hearts of Tory grassroots, he rewrote his pitch as a crusade against “ woke nonsense ”. To woo fanatical Eurosceptics away from Truss, he promised to shred every legacy EU regulation in British law within 100 days of taking office – a commitment as dangerous as it was unrealistic. When Sunak did eventually become leader, his mandate was to clear up the mess left by the person his party had trusted more than him to believe what they believed. The circumstances made a virtue of stability under a prime minister who wouldn’t move fast or break things. But as time goes on, and stability shades into stagnation and decay, there will have to be some sense of direction, of purpose at the top. Then living on a remote planet made of money could be a real problem for the prime minister; not because he is rich, but because he isn’t anything else. Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist",

    "title": "Kimmel on Trump’s plan to arm teachers: ‘stupid and dangerous’",
    "author": "Guardian staff",
    "content": "Jimmy Kimmel On Jimmy Kimmel Live!, the host spoke about Donald Trump’s recent financial disclosure report which told us many things about the former president’s dealings but also that he made just $201 from his much-trumpeted social media platform Truth Social. Kimmel joked that it was “less than he would have made if he started a lemonade stand outside of Mar-a-Lago” before also revealing that it is the 10,953th most visited site in the world, “more than a thousand spots behind arbys.com”. He moved on to the Fox News/Dominion trial with the network in “a very difficult position now” as proceedings are set to begin with damning evidence against them including texts in which execs openly talk about how dumb Trump’s lawyers were. Trump recently posted that Fox should double down and continue to report the falsehoods they are currently being sued over. Kimmel said it was “like if OJ tried on the glove then turned around and killed Johnnie Cochran with it”. Kimmel then moved on to his recent appearance at an NRA convention, where he called for teachers across the US to be armed to help combat school shootings. “What a remarkably stupid and dangerous idea,” Kimmel said. He joked that if this had been the case when he was at school, “my Spanish teacher would have shot me at least 15 times”. At the same event, Mike Pence also spoke, “there to fire things up and really rock their Glocks off” and while he is predicted to make an announcement over his presidential campaign, Kimmel said “he might as well announce he’s running for wide receiver of the Colts”. The far-right news network Newsmax recently aired a segment over concerns that the increase in LGBTQ+ people will have a devastating effect on the future of humanity, noting that the plan is apparently to turn everyone gay. If that happens, Kimmel said that he guesses “maybe we’ll have a lot of brunch”. He added: “There’s so much fear about sexuality and gender and wokeness. Mostly people don’t even know what woke means, it’s just a word that gives Tucker Carlson a rage-boner every night when he goes to sleep.” Stephen Colbert On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert spoke about Joe Biden’s trip to Ireland, which has been “everything he dreamed it would be”. He played footage of a recent speech where Biden ended with “let’s go lick the world”, a phrase that Colbert confessed to having “no idea what the hell that means”. During another appearance at his ancestral home of County Mayo, Biden made his “first ever WWE entrance” on stage to dramatic light. Biden said “I see the light” to the attendees. Colbert joked: “There are three things you never say at your age, sir: ‘I see the light’, ‘that can wait until tomorrow’ and ‘I’ll drive’.” The Fox News/Dominion trial has been delayed and may even be settled before it begins. “You cannot take this away from me, this is my Super Bowl,” Colbert said. He moved on to Clarence Thomas, the supreme court justice who was revealed to have accepted lavish gifts and trips on the yacht and private jet of the billionaire Harlan Crow, who also collects Nazi memorabilia. The last week has also shown that Crow bought the house where Thomas’s elderly mother is living rent-free. His defence is that he wants to create a public museum at the Thomas home. “Just a reminder that Harlan Crow has Hitler’s napkins and a statue of Stalin in his garden so building you a museum: not a huge compliment,” Colbert said.",

    "title": "Dubravka Ugrešić obituary",
    "author": "Marina Warner",
    "content": "The writer Dubravka Ugrešić, who has died aged 73, disliked borders, and came to think of herself as transnational or even postnational. While in her native Yugoslavia, as it then was, at the age of 22 she published her first work, a characteristically experimental and effervescent children’s book called Little Flame (1971). Fording the Stream of Consciousness (1988) dramatises an international literary conference in which characters from books and their authors turn up to confront scholars who are, in their view, horribly misrepresenting them. Light-footed yet learned, it displays Dubravka’s masterly literary range, expertise, and her love of parody and gift of ventriloquism. The witty, playful, absurdist fictions that followed as her life became more complex won esteem and many prizes. In the trouble-free days before the former Yugoslavia was consumed in the civil wars of the 90s, she dwelt in opposing worlds, as a strikingly imaginative writer of fiction and an academic at the University of Zagreb, a city that before Yugoslavia’s formation in 1918 had been part of the Austro-Hungarian empire. She specialised in the Russian avant garde, reading and editing works by writers several of whom had been imprisoned or executed, their works censured and forgotten. After the communist leader Marshal Tito died in 1980, Yugoslavia eventually disaggregated into separate nation states , with Croatia and Slovenia declaring independence in 1991, and Dubravka was caught in the crossfire. With a Bulgarian mother, she was not sufficiently pure ethnically, and as a Russian speaker who had studied in Moscow during the Soviet era she was politically suspect for revanchist nostalgia and communist sympathies. An article in 1992 denounced her, alongside four other women writers including Slavenka Drakulič , as “the five Croatian witches”. Crucifixes began appearing in the university’s rooms and personal offices, and when Dubravka expressed horror at the new nationalists’ selective memory, her colleagues shunned her. In 1993, she left the new nation, almost unthinkingly; as she said later, it was an impulsive move: “I decided to take my broom and fly away.” Her existence as a nomad, a migrant, a transnational began – she rejected the word exile for its claim on glamour. Her writing turned more acerbic and melancholy, characterised by unsparing, Swiftian trenchancy, but nevertheless lit up by mischievous wit and flashes of empathy for the victims of the inane developments she was diagnosing. With an incomparable range of cultural references, she gathered material for scathing essays on the cultural norms in her new places of unbelonging – from psychotherapy to shopping malls, Disney to cosmetic surgery and beauty farms. Her writing turned more acerbic and melancholy, characterised by unsparing, Swiftian trenchancy Ingratiation and flattery were as foreign to Dubravka as snow on the equator. She liked to invoke Isaiah Berlin’s distinction between foxes and hedgehogs, but, although she identified passionately with the creature that knows many things rather than one big thing, she could be more accurately compared to a porcupine, or perhaps a sea urchin whose prickles are even more barbed and lethal. Have a Nice Day (1994) is an essay collection that dissects American hypocrisies; The Culture of Lies (1996) damns the ideological erasures of history; Nobody’s Home (2005) investigates the question of Europe, the meaning of belonging, the nostalgia for a fantasised past; Thank You for Not Reading (2016) fearlessly attacks the venality of the publishing industry. She liked to invoke as a model the boy in the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale The Emperor’s New Clothes, who points out what everybody else is failing to see – or at least pretending not to. Alongside these collections she developed a high-spirited form that she dubbed “patchwork fiction”, composed of autobiography, flâneurism, political satire, literary commentary and carnivalesque plotting. Some of her earliest loves, such as Mikhail Bulgakov , Nikolai Gogol and Velimir Khlebnikov , haunt these dynamic experiments. The novels, like the essays, bubble with her multifaceted enthusiasms – ranging from screwball comedies to children’s literature (Alice, Peter Pan, The Wizard of Oz), Slavic folklore, animal fables and fairytales from the world over. In these patchworks, such as The Museum of Unconditional Surrender (1999), she records, the New York Times reviewer wrote, “not the gory amputation of refugee flight, but arrival’s greyer course of tissue rejection”. In The Ministry of Pain (2004), thought by some critics to be her finest novel, she mines this rich composite seam to portray the freedoms of the west and their distortions, and retrieve “confiscated memories” in the new political order after 1989. In Baba Yaga Laid an Egg (2007) and Fox (2017) she enjoys herself by reclaiming vilified female figures such as crones, shrews – and witches. Born in Kutina, south-east of Zagreb, Dubravka was the daughter of Veta (Elizaveta, nee Stoikova), from Burgas, who worked as a medical administrator, and Nikola Ugrešić, who had fought as a partisan against the fascists during the second world war, and became director of a petrochemical plant in the city. Dubravka studied comparative and Russian literature at the University of Zagreb and in Moscow, and later taught in the institute of literary theory at Zagreb (1973-93). After she was forced to leave, she lived hand-to-mouth on her earnings and awards, surviving on coffee and cigarettes, and on visiting fellowships at US universities – Radcliffe, UCLA, Columbia, Wesleyan – and in Germany and the Netherlands, until more by accident than design she settled in Amsterdam. She took out Dutch citizenship in 2004, always refused to call herself a Croatian writer and continued to write in Serbo-Croatian, despite the Serbian and other aspects of the region’s common language being ostracised in Croatia. When the Royal Society of Literature elected her one of their international writers in 2021, she wrote how delighted she was because she had no home but literature. When elected to the Royal Society of Literature, she wrote how delighted she was because she had no home but literature She did begin to revisit the land of her birth, mainly to be with her mother during her last years; she travelled back with her to Sofia, but, as she relates wistfully in Baba Yaga Laid an Egg, they found nothing recognisable. Dubravka also spent summers by the sea on the Dalmatian coast with her brother and his family. She wrote in a deeply melancholy vein as well as with adroit comic wit: she recognised that she had an element of litost , as explored by Milan Kundera: a pervasive ironical ruefulness which is “a deep understanding of human inadequacy”. Her unusual mixture of Orwellian stringency and madcap lightness won her readers across 30 languages. Awards included the Neustadt international prize for literature in 2016, and she was much bruited as a candidate for the Nobel. Writing in what she termed “a small language”, studiedly ignored in her own country (her books were even removed from libraries at one time), Dubravka learned to speak English very expressively, but she depended on translators, among them Michael Henry Heim, Celia Hawkesworth and, for the recent works, David Williams and Ellen Elias-Bursač. Her honesty and straight-talking, her shafts and barbs, did not make her life any easier. Dubravka prided herself that she stood in a proud, endangered writerly lineage; she was also an affectionate, funny, thoughtful and always stimulating friend. She is survived by her brother Siniša and his children, Korina and Nikola. • Dubravka Ugrešić, writer, born 27 March 1949; died 17 March 2023 • This article was amended on 19 April 2023. Veta Ugrešić came from the Bulgarian city of Burgas, not Varna as an earlier version said.",

    "title": "SNP treasurer arrested in party funding investigation",
    "author": "Severin Carrell Scotland editor",
    "content": "The Scottish National party’s treasurer, Colin Beattie, has been arrested as a suspect in the police investigation into the party’s funding and finances. Police Scotland said Beattie, 71, had been taken into custody and was being interviewed by detectives. Beattie’s detention follows the arrest earlier this month of Peter Murrell, Nicola Sturgeon’s husband and the former chief executive of the SNP, at their home in Glasgow, and the seizure of a motorhome parked outside Murrell’s mother’s house in Fife. Murrell was released later that day without charge, pending further investigation. Beattie, the SNP MSP for Midlothian North and Musselburgh and a former banker, had previously served as party treasurer for 16 years until he lost the post in an internal election to Douglas Chapman. Chapman then resigned as treasurer in 2021 after protesting that he had not had sufficient access to the party’s financial information. Beattie stepped in to replace him. In a brief statement, the force said: “A 71-year-old man has today, Tuesday, 18 April 2023, been arrested as a suspect in connection with the ongoing investigation into the funding and finances of the Scottish National party. The man is in custody and is being questioned by Police Scotland detectives. A report will be sent to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service.” Humza Yousaf, Sturgeon’s successor as first minister, told reporters at Holyrood he would be talking to Beattie in due course about whether Beattie would remain as party treasurer and as an SNP member of Holyrood’s public audit committee. Yousaf said Beattie’s arrest “was a very serious matter”, but added: “People are innocent until proven guilty.” Beattie’s arrest took place hours before the first minister made a significant policy statement at Holyrood where Yousaf plans to set out the policy priorities of his new government, in an effort to reset the party after weeks of in-fighting. Yousaf acknowledged the timing of today’s police action was therefore “far from ideal”. The police investigation was launched in 2021 after complaints were made about the SNP’s handling of over £600,000 in donations given to the party, ostensibly for a fresh independence referendum campaign launched in 2019. It emerged that money was not put into a separate, segregated SNP account but Sturgeon said it was all accounted for, and the equivalent figure would be spent by the party on that referendum campaign. Speaking in 2021, Sturgeon said: “Money hasn’t gone missing; all money goes through the SNP accounts independently all fully audited. We don’t hold separate accounts – we’re under no legal requirement to do that. Our accounts are managed on a cashflow basis, but every penny we raise to support the campaign for independence will be spent on the campaign for independence.” So far, no campaign has been launched. Last week, it emerged that Johnston Carmichael, the accountancy firm, quit as the SNP’s external auditors. On Saturday, Beattie reportedly told the SNP executive committee the party was having difficulty balancing its books because it had lost 30,000 members over the last 12 months and had extra costs to pay due to the police investigation. Humza Yousaf, the newly elected SNP leader, said the party was solvent. Beattie backed Yousaf’s main rival in the party leadership contest, Kate Forbes. Opposition parties said Beattie’s party membership should be suspended – a move that has precedent after other SNP parliamentarians were suspended after they came under investigation over financial issues. Yousaf has previously rejected opposition demands to suspend Murrell and Sturgeon because of the police inquiry, and said on Tuesday he would not suspend Beattie. Craig Hoy, the Scottish Conservative party chair, said Beattie should step down from his place on Holyrood’s public audit committee until the police investigation was over. He said the police investigation was “consuming the party”. “Humza Yousaf has to get a grip of the situation, rather than stand by wringing his hands,” he said. “This extremely serious matter is escalating by the day and everyone in the SNP has a duty to be as transparent as possible about what they knew and when.” Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour’s deputy leader, said it was another “deeply concerning development” and that the Police Scotland investigation “must be allowed to proceed”.",

    "title": "Monthly insolvencies in England and Wales hit three-year high",
    "author": "Phillip Inman",
    "content": "More companies in England and Wales went bankrupt in March than at any point since monthly records began three years ago. With businesses struggling to pay rising billsand higher interest rates while the economy stagnates, the Insolvency Service said the number of corporate insolvencies jumped to 2,457 last month, up 16% on a year earlier and up from 1,784 in February. The rise also represented a 55% leap compared with pre-pandemic levels in March 2019, when 1,581 companies went bust. Insolvency experts said the rate of company collapses was likely to keep rising during the year as more businesses throw in the towel amid stubbornly high inflation and rising interest rates. In Cardiff, Louise O’Leary, who owns and runs the Frolics Cafe on the city’s outskirts, said the escalating costs of food, energy and staff wages to compensate for inflation had forced her to rely on credit cards to pay bills. “Those higher costs have cleared out any profit I used to make and meant I need loans to survive,” she said. O’Leary employs one full-time and seven part-time staff and is increasing prices to close the gap between her outgoings and income. “But we need to do that slowly because so many of our customers are on low incomes,” she said, adding that she was especially angry that the government had ended its business energy support scheme . “I cannot understand why during the pandemic small businesses were looked after and now we are being thrown to the dogs. How can you be so highly regarded one minute and not regarded at all the next,” she said. Government support programmes during the Covid-19 pandemic are credited with preventing a wave of companies falling into insolvency. But recent cuts are expected to mean insolvency rates rise again. David Kelly, the head of insolvency at the accountant PwC, said: “Businesses are struggling to secure financing and pay off their loans due to high interest rates and the wider impact inflation and consumer sentiment is having on sales and cashflows. Company insolvencies will likely continue to rise in the short term, making for a challenging spring.” The Insolvency Service said creditors’ voluntary liquidations, a process that allows directors to formally close a company they believe has become insolvent, were the biggest driver of corporate insolvency in March. Individual insolvencies also rose sharply in March, although they were down 1% on a year ago. Breathing space applications – which holds off creditor action for 60 days so people in debt can reorganise their finances – rose to a new high in March, having been introduced in May 2021. Christina Fitzgerald, the president of the insolvency and restructuring trade body R3 and a partner at the law firm Edwin Coe said: “Business owners have spent three years trading through a pandemic and economic uncertainty, and an increasing number are choosing to shut their businesses before that choice is taken away from them and as the turbulent trading climate proves too much.” Fitzgerald said April would be a turning point for many businesses after the withdrawal in March of the government’s energy bill relief scheme. She said it meant “many businesses will be facing further increases in costs at a time when they can ill-afford them”.",

    "title": "UK company mining gold in Amazon on disputed land",
    "author": "Fernanda Wenzel and Jonathan Watts",
    "content": "A London-listed company has been mining gold in the Amazon rainforest without approval from the Brazilian land agency or the consent of nearby Indigenous communities, according to an investigation by the Guardian and partners. Serabi Gold has been blasting 4.5 metre-wide tunnels and trucking ore from the Coringa project site in Pará state. But interviews with land agency officials and documents seen by the Guardian, Unearthed and Sumaúma indicate that ownership of the area is disputed and the land was allegedly occupied by illegal land-grabbers. The case illustrates the ethical quagmire of land and mining regulations in Brazil, which are often contradictory and subject to widely different interpretation from government to government, and bureau to bureau. Serabi says it is fully compliant with the Brazilian legal mining framework, and is in the process of an impact study with the local communities, after which it is confident that the full installation licence will be granted. The Coringa mine is located in an area known as Terra Nossa. Until 2003, this was a part of Baú Indigenous land, where the Kayapó Mekrãgnoti people live. In 2006 the government land agency Incra set aside this part of the Baú land for settlement by small-scale family farmers. But, as is often the case in the Amazon, grileiros – a slang Portuguese term that can be translated as “land grabbers” – had already been operating in the area, and one of those who claimed a plot there without authorisation, according to Incra, was Benedito Gonçalves Neto. “Benedito simply appropriated the land and said that it was his. So much so that we have an [ongoing] administrative process at Incra to take back these areas,” said Antônio José Ferreira da Silva, an Incra official who wrote a 2017 report about the unauthorised mining. The settlement went ahead in other parts of the area, but in 2016 a Canadian mining company called Chapleau, which is now wholly owned by Serabi as of December 2017 , struck a deal with Neto, according to Incra. In return for a one-off payment of R$21,428 (£3,420), monthly payments of R$1,428 (£228) and royalties from any ore extracted, the company was given the right to use the land as it wished, including mining, deforestation and construction of buildings and tailings ponds. “From the signing of the contracts Chapleau effectively controlled the areas, acting as an enclave in the settlement project,” Incra noted in the 2017 report. The mine started exploratory production last year and Serabi reported 1,013 ounces (28.7 kg) of gold from Coringa. In future, it aims to extract more than a tonne of gold, worth $70m (£56m) each year. But this is happening against a complex and confusing backdrop. It appears that the company is operating with no approval from the land agency, without the consent of nearby Indigenous groups and without the payment of a fee to those who have made a rival claim to the property. Incra is currently analysing a request from Serabi to operate in the area, but the agency confirmed in an email that “to date, Incra has not authorised research and mining operations in the Terra Nossa settlement”. Interactive Brazil’s mining code allows companies to sign trial mining agreements with “the owners or occupants” of the land, regardless of whether their claim is legally recognised, and pay royalties. In this case Brazil’s mining agency, ANM, and Pará state’s environmental and sustainability department, Semas, both issued operating licences, which were automatically renewed last August, despite a court order that the Coringa project should not receive authorisation until the company concluded a consultation with nearby Indigenous communities. The mining agency subsequently halted approval in February of this year. “There is no current authorisation for mining in these areas,” ANM said in a statement. However, Serabi says that under Brazilian law the licenses are automatically extended as long as renewal applications have been submitted. In an update published last month, it said: “The company confirms that renewal applications have been submitted within the stipulated time frames and that no notifications have been received from the issuing authorities that renewal will not be approved. Accordingly, these licences, which had an initial expiry date of 8 August 2022, remain valid.” They also state that they have been in regular contact with Incra over the issue of land permits. Meanwhile the local population say they were not consulted before the mining began. Bepdjo Mekrãgnotire, a member of the Kayapó people, said he first became aware the mine was in operation due to the sound of explosives. “We were collecting Brazil nuts last year and the noise scared us. That’s when we found out,” he told a reporter from Unearthed. “The company should have consulted us before, because we have the right to speak, to charge. They are already working without consulting us, and we want to be compensated.” The company confirms that it started a consultation process with Indigenous communities early last year, but it is not yet complete. “While progress has been slower than we were originally led to believe, the final report is expected to be available to be presented to the authorities for their review in the next few weeks,” Serabi’s chief executive, Mike Hodge, said in his statement to investors . Neto and his business partner geologist Antonio Carlos Machado Matias told the Guardian and Unearthed that they had bought the area surrounding Coringa 20 years ago at a time when “nobody had land titles in the Amazon”. They say they had signed agreements and received payments from Chapleau, until Serabi took over. Matias said they had applied to Incra three times – in 2007, 2013 and 2021 – to have the land regularised, but in every case they were turned down. He and his partner believe they should be receiving royalties from Serabi, but he said the company stopped talking to them or paying them soon after they bought Chapleau. “Since there is an Incra decree, I have no way of saying that I have dominion over the area. So what can I do? Nothing … Even though I have old ownership documents, when Incra came and put the PDS [the acronym for land set aside for sustainable development] on top , that’s it, you lose.” Serabi agrees that the land ownership is “disputed”. In its statement last month, it said: “All royalties due to the relevant landowner are currently being provided for by the company and payment will be made to the appropriate title holder as and when title is formally confirmed.” All the while the complexities of the region are growing, with deforestation, crime and land conflicts plaguing the area. The Terra Nossa settlement that was supposed to house 1,000 households only holds 300, who face constant intimidation, and at least five people have been murdered there since 2011. Serabi is not implicated in the violence or killings, but by operating in the area without the permission of Incra, it has been accused of endorsing the illegal acquisition of the property and undermining the settlement project. “Chapleau [now Serabi] refuses to acknowledge the settlement, and recognises as the owner of the area a guy who grabbed public land using fraud,” said Incra’s Ferreira da Silva. In a separate statement to the Guardian and its partners, the company said: “Serabi operates and complies with the Brazilian legal mining framework, we have all the required permits for our trial mining operation at Coringa and we are completely comfortable with our legal position and behaviour in relation to the ongoing disputed land ownership within which Coringa sits. Serabi has been operating in Pará state for over 20 years and remains committed to working with all stakeholders, supporting local communities and operating in an environmentally sensitive manner.” Felício Pontes Junior, the senior public prosecutor who has been accompanying the case in the high court, said: “I hope that there will be an exemplary punishment to this company and that this will serve as an example to the other mining companies, especially the foreign ones, which today settle in the Amazon without respect to the basic rights of the traditional peoples.” Ana Carolina Alfinito, a postdoctoral law researcher and a legal consultant at Amazon Watch , a nonprofit organisation working to protect the rainforest and Indigenous people, said this was an example of poor corporate social and environmental governance. “Everything regarding this project is wrong,” she said. “It is absurd that a company is operating without Incra’s permission inside a settlement for so many years.”",

    "title": "Up to one in 20 new diabetes cases could be linked to Covid, study suggests",
    "author": "Linda Geddes",
    "content": "Up to one in 20 new diabetes cases could be related to Covid infection, data suggests. The research adds to mounting evidence the pandemic may be contributing to a rapidly escalating diabetes crisis , with individuals who have experienced more severe Covid at greatest risk. However, lifestyle factors such as being overweight or obese continue to be the main driver for the increase, with 4.3 million officially diagnosed cases in the UK alone. Although previous research has hinted that Sars-CoV-2 infection may increase the risk of developing diabetes – possibly by damaging insulin-producing cells in the pancreas – these studies were either relatively small or limited to specific groups of individuals, such as US military veterans, who may not represent the general population. To delve deeper, Prof Naveed Janjua at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, and his colleagues turned to the British Columbia Covid-19 Cohort , a surveillance platform that links data on Covid infections and vaccinations with sociodemographic and administrative health data. They examined records from 629,935 people who took a PCR test for Covid and found those who tested positive were significantly more likely to experience a new diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes in the following weeks and months – with 3-5% of new diabetes cases attributable to Covid overall. “Another way to phrase this is out of 100 people with diabetes, 3-5% are related to Sars-CoV-2 infection,” said Janjua, whose research was published in the JAMA Network Open medical journal. Men and women who were hospitalised with Covid appeared to be at greatest risk. However, among the general population, the association between Sars-CoV-2 infection and diabetes risk was significant only for men – possibly due to sex-specific immune responses to the virus. “Given the large number of people infected with Covid-19, these excess diabetes cases could translate into very large population level burden of diabetes which could strain already stretched healthcare systems,” Janjuar said. “This highlights the importance of healthcare organisations and medical professionals being mindful of the possible long-term outcomes of Covid-19. It may be important to monitor individuals who have recovered from Covid-19 for diabetes, especially those who had more severe disease during the acute phase of infection, as early detection and treatment can be critical in managing diabetes. In addition, diet and physical activity may help in controlling diabetes risk.” Dr Caroline Ponmani, a consultant in paediatric emergency medicine at Queen’s hospital in Romford, Essex, who has been investigating links between Covid and the development of type 1 diabetes in children, said: “This is new and highly interesting data which has long-term implications in resource planning and allocation. It has a longer follow-up time compared to other studies, and it appears that the incidence of new onset diabetes continues to be high after Sars-CoV-2 infection.” Although individuals in this study were predominantly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, which is more common in adults, Ponmani’s research suggests Covid infection is more likely to be associated with the development of type 1 diabetes in children. During the first year of the pandemic she identified a 17% increase in new onset diabetes cases among children across the UK and Ireland, compared with a background incidence of 3-5% over the past 10 years. More than 95% of these children were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. The latest data from the National Paediatric Diabetes Audit for England and Wales also reports that 2021 and 2022 have been high incidence years for new onset type 1 diabetes in children, Ponmani said. Even so, further research is needed to confirm that the virus is the direct cause of people’s diabetes. Another possibility is that more cases are being picked up as a result of screening when people with Covid are admitted to hospital, or that some of these cases are transient and may resolve over time. “What we need to find out is longer term, is this true diabetes?” said Kamlesh Khunti, a professor of primary care diabetes and vascular medicine at the University of Leicester. Assuming the virus is directly to blame, the underlying mechanism also still needs to be teased out. “Some studies have suggested that Sars-CoV-2 could infect cells that produce insulin in pancreas, leading to alteration of their function and insulin production, while other studies are not conclusive on this theory,” said Janjua. “It is also suggested that chronic low-grade inflammation common in people with obesity, a problem with the autonomic nervous system, hyperactivated immune response or autoimmunity, could also play a role in diabetes.”",

    "author": "Joanna Partridge",
    "content": "British free range eggs will soon start returning to supermarket shelves, following the lifting of restrictions introduced last year by the government in an attempt to curb the spread of bird flu. A legal requirement for poultry and other captive birds to be kept indoors was introduced in England last November, and in Wales the next month, in response to the UK’s largest outbreak of avian influenza . The move piled more pressure on poultry producers, who had already warned of supply shortages amid rising costs, which prompted some supermarkets to ration egg sales. Related: ‘We have lost a lot of control’: UK at risk of food fraud, safety expert warns The government housing order was lifted at midnight on Tuesday, allowing hens and other birds to go outside for the first time in months. The chief veterinary officer confirmed the decision, after a new assessment of the risk of avian influenza. As a result, boxes of eggs will be able to once again be labelled “free range”. Eggs cannot be classed as free range if the birds that have laid them have been kept indoors for longer than 16 weeks . After that time, eggs are required to be called barn eggs. An outbreak of H5N1 bird flu was first confirmed in the UK in late October 2021, and accelerated during 2022. Officials have said the disease circulates among wild birds, but it is also deadly for captive birds including hens and turkeys. Outbreaks are devastating for farmers because they sweep through flocks , and prompt a cull of birds that have not succumbed to the illness. While the lifting of the housing order has been widely welcomed, officials are warning bird keepers to keep biosecurity measures in place to prevent future outbreaks. Dr Christine Middlemiss, the UK’s chief veterinary officer, said: “The unprecedented nature of this outbreak has proved it’s more important than ever for bird keepers to remain vigilant for signs of disease and maintain stringent standards of biosecurity.” The decision to allow poultry and other birds outside again, as the risks from bird flu reduce, does not remove all of the pressure facing egg producers. Since the start of the war in Ukraine last February, the cost of animal feed and energy has skyrocketed . Egg producers’ energy bills were further increased by the need to keep animals indoors in lit and heated barns over the winter. In addition, the cost of fuel, packaging and labour increased significantly in 2022 and has not fallen so far this year. Robert Gooch, the chief executive of the British Free Range Egg Producers Association (BFREPA) said farmers’ costs were not covered by the price they are paid for their eggs. “Many free range egg farmers were already losing money on every egg laid, so price rises were desperately needed even before costs rocketed. “The price shoppers are paying in the shops had to increase, and it has, but farmers are still only receiving about £1.35 a dozen – less than half what a dozen eggs sells for in the shops.” The BFREPA represents about 550 egg businesses, which account for about 70% of the UK’s free range and organic egg production, supplying the country’s largest retailers. Egg farmers have said that increased costs may have a longer-term impact , as squeezed producers leave the industry or reduce the size of their flocks in the face of spiralling costs.",

    "content": "An elegant Edinburgh property that was given to Queen Elizabeth II in her role as sovereign, and for more than 40 years was managed by the UK government, is being privately rented out by the king for a profit. \n The revelation sheds light on the opaque nature of royal wealth, where public and private ownership is often hard to disentangle. It adds to mounting questions around Buckingham Palace’s policy on gifts, which is supposed to prevent official gifts from being treated as private property. \n \n \n \n \n \n Cost of the crown is an investigation into royal wealth and finances. The series, published ahead of the coronation of King Charles III, is seeking to overcome centuries of secrecy to better understand how the royal family is funded, the extent to which individual members have profited from their public roles, and the dubious origins of some of their wealth. The Guardian believes it is in the public interest to clarify what can legitimately be called private wealth, what belongs to the British people, and what, as so often is the case, straddles the two. \n • Read more about the investigation \n • Fund Guardian investigative journalism that uncovers the secrets of the powerful that we all need to know \n \n \n \n \n \n The Georgian house in Edinburgh’s New Town area, which is divided into two flats, was given to the queen in 1953 by its previous owner. \n Property records show that in early 1954 it was registered as being held by a government department “as the minister of the crown … for and on behalf of her majesty and her royal successors”, suggesting it was considered an official gift to the queen as the sovereign. \n Government papers uncovered by the Guardian show that for decades the property was treated as a state-owned building and used as “grace and favour” homes for dignitaries and employees of the royal household. \n But in the mid-1990s, the government stopped taking responsibility for running “grace and favour” properties and handed over their maintenance and management to Buckingham Palace. This did not initially happen to the Edinburgh flats, which a Treasury official noted in 1994 “appear to be set in a time warp”. \n The building needed significant upgrading work. There was a long debate involving civil servants and the keeper of the privy purse, the official in charge of the monarch’s finances, about whether the government should meet those costs if the property was about to be given to the royal household. \n Officials in the then Department of the Environment had offered the royal family a payment of £6,000, equivalent to more than £11,000 at today’s prices, in lieu of the incomplete modernisation work. \n Official government documents show that in August 1995, senior civil servants questioned this arrangement, saying it “would be asking for trouble” if the government gave the royal household money for the renovations, “doubly so as the house might be regarded as the queen’s own property”. \n The government’s papers show that civil servants believed the property would remain part of the “grace and favour” estate and be paid for by the royal household after it was handed over to the sovereign. \n It has emerged that the apartments, which are estimated to be worth between £1.5m and £1.8m, instead became part of the queen’s private estate. They are held by Canup Ltd, the company that owns the king’s extensive lands and houses at Balmoral and Delnadamph in the Scottish Highlands on his behalf. The flats are being let to private tenants at full market rates. \n \n Related: What are the rules on gifts for the royal family? \n \n The palace’s policy on official gifts states that they “are not the private property of the member of the royal family who receives them.” \n It is not known whether the queen knew the previous owners of the Edinburgh house – a physician and his wife – before it was donated to her in 1953. It seems unlikely as the queen was only seven when the physician died and his widow then moved to Canada. Certainly, the house was treated as an official gift when it was put into the government’s control in 1954. \n Andy Wightman, a Scottish land reform expert and former Scottish Green party MSP, said the house seemed to have been a publicly owned asset used to help the royal family’s employees or people associated with the royal family. That was a form of public benefit, he said. \n “Since the property is now being rented out on a commercial basis as part of the king’s personal property portfolio, this historic understanding no longer has any validity,” he said. “The king should pay a market price for the property to the government.” \n A palace spokesperson said: “In the 1990s, at the request of the Department of the Environment, the property was handed back to the queen who took on the responsibility for its maintenance and upkeep privately.” \n The palace spokesperson did not comment on whether the queen had known its previous owner. \n Interactive",
